                    <p>As if the spirits of our ancestors weren't trouble enough, now we're haunted by the ghosts of our
                        descendants. Ken Kesey claims that ecology is the current handy smokescreen for everybody's Dire
                        Report — the voice of white-eyed paranoia. Gary Snyder (strong proponent of population control)
                        when told of an Earth of solid people impending soon, commented dreamily "think of all that
                        consciousness."</p>
                    <p>I tend to view the whole disaster as an opportunity to try stuff. If you take all the
                        surprise-free projections for mankind's near future and connect them up, they lead neat as you
                        please right into the dead end meat grinder. The only Earth we had, used up. Unless there are
                        surprises. Which is what we're here for. The Standard Operating Out, when a species is in a
                        bind, is to diversify. Multiply alternatives. If you don't know what's coming, the way to evolve
                        ahead of the changes is to try everything.</p>
                    <p class="dontsplit">Reasonable laws made by reasonable men in reasonable times proscribe trying
                        everything. For a
                        good reason: people get hurt trying stuff. If you're bound to try stuff anyway, then either
                        you're working directly for City Hall or you're an outlaw, or both.</p>
                    <p>Buckminster Fuller: "It surprises people when you tell them that since the last ice age
                        three-quarters of the earth has been water, and of the one-quarter that is land very little has
                        been lived on. Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the
                        earth, and anyone who went outside of it — the tiny minority that went to sea, for example —
                        immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in
                        the outlaw area, where you're dealing with the toughness of nature. I find this fascinating and
                        utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can't reform man, and you
                        can't improve his situation where he is. But when you've made things so good out there in the
                        outlaw area that they can't help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated." [From
                        Calvin Tomkin's profile of Fuller, " In the Outlaw Area", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]</p>

                        <p>Loose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area
                            The specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let's
                            say
                            it's an island. For society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail
                            sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can't
                            come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to
                            return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple
                            barrel.
                            For the individual it serves as an always possible alternative to the situation he's in. rie
                            can
                            simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one's going to try to get him
                            back.
                            For evolution it's an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum
                            prior
                            form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. "In wildness is the preservation
                            of
                            the world."
                            It's difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the
                            history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein
                            has a
                            book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It's kind of
                            nice:
                            they have a revolution and throw the jailers out. Depending on the size of the island, my
                            expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China,
                            warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian
                            haven
                            for the most useful pioneers — the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey's notion) bending
                            reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.
