Over 2,000 people attended in person, with hundreds more watching live streams of the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The WordCamp was a great success with plenty of first-time attendees and new WordPress contributors getting involved in the project and community. Recorded sessions from the 65 speakers at the event will be available on WordPress.tv in the coming weeks. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wceu/albums\">photos from the event</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/wordcamp-europe-2019/\">The next WordCamp Europe</a> takes place on June 20-22 2019 in Berlin, Germany. If you’re based in Europe and would like to serve on the organizing team, <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/call-wordcamp-europe-2019-organizers/\">fill in the application form</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updated Roadmap for the New WordPress Content Editor</h2>\n\n<p>During his keynote session at WordCamp Europe, Matt Mullenweg presented <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/mullenweg-on-gutenberg-roll-out-plan/\">an updated roadmap</a> for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>, the new content editor coming in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<p>While the editor is in rapid development, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\">with v3.1 being released this past month</a>, the team is aiming to ship Gutenberg with WordPress Core in August, 2018. This is not set in stone — the release date may shift as development progresses — but this gives the first realistic idea of when we can expect the editor to be released.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contribute to Gutenberg, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">the handbook</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordCamp Incubator Cities Announced</h2>\n\n<p>The WordCamp Incubator program helps spread WordPress to underserved communities by providing organizing support for their first WordCamp. The first iteration of this program ran successfully in 2016 and empowered three cities to start their own WordPress communities.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the Community Team is running the Incubator program again. After receiving applications from 104 communities, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/06/26/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-locations-announcement/\">they have selected</a> Montevideo, Uruguay and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia to participate in the program. Both cities will receive direct help from experienced WordCamp organizers to run their first-ever WordCamp as a way to help their WordPress community get started.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about the Incubator program follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community team blog</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The WordPress community of Spain recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_es/status/1004681694660603904\">received an award</a> for being the best open-source community in the country.</li>\n	<li>This month, WordPress reached <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">the milestone of powering 31% of websites</a>.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://wprig.io/introducing-wprig-wordpress/\">WP Rig</a> is a brand new tool to help WordPress developers build better themes.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/gutenberg-block-unit-test/\">Block Unit Test</a> is a new plugin to help theme developers prepare for Gutenberg.</li>\n	<li>Near the end of the month, Zac Gordon hosted <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\">an online conference</a> focused on JavaScript development in WordPress &#8211; the session videos will be available on YouTube soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"The Month in WordPress: May 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 09:09:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:360:\"This month saw two significant milestones in the WordPress community — the 15th anniversary of the project, and GDPR-related privacy tools coming to WordPress Core.

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

The Community Team has been hard at work helping communities around the world plan local anniversary parties.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">the central anniversary website</a> to see if there’s already a party being planned near you. These parties are all organized by local communities — if there’s no local community in your area, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/#starting-a-new-meetup-com-group\">start one today</a> and host a party yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Work has Started on a Gutenberg Migration Guide</h2>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg, the upcoming WordPress content editor, in rapid development, a lot of people have been wondering how they will convert their existing plugins to work with the new features. To mitigate the issues here and help people overcome any migration hurdles, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/26/your-help-wanted-gutenberg-migration-guide/\">a Gutenberg Migration Guide is underway</a> to assist developers with making their code Gutenberg-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to this guide, you can review <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide\">the existing documentation on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide/issues\">open a new issue</a> if you find something to add.</p>\n\n<h2>Theme Review Team Launches Trusted Authors Program</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of themes submitted to the Theme Directory can take quite a while to complete. In order to combat this issue and to make the theme submission process smoother for everyone, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/04/30/trusted-authors-program/\">the Theme Review Team is introducing a Trusted Authors Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This program will allow frequent and reliable theme authors to apply for trusted status, allowing them to upload themes more frequently and to have their themes automatically approved. This will allow more high-quality themes to be added to the directory, as well as recognize the hard work that authors put in to build their themes.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved with reviewing themes, you can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">their getting started guide</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">team blog</a> and join the #themereview channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 4.9.5 was released</a> early this month, fixing numerous bugs and potential security issues.

The passes come with a single license that provide access to a group of extensions. The prices for each pass were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: $199</li><li>Extended Pass: $399</li><li>Professional Pass: $699</li><li>All Access Pass: $899</li></ul>\n\n<p>After six weeks, Williamson noticed that customers were continuing to purchase individual extensions instead of the passes. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Our expectation and intent in creating the passes was for store owners to be able to purchase access to multiple individual extensions in a more economical way, but that’s not what happened,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead, store owners continued to purchase only the individual extensions they needed because the price tags of the passes were still too high. It is clear that we made a mistake in our pass pricing, and so today we’d like to apologize for that and announce new, lower prices.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>After two weeks of testing, the prices of each pass have been significantly reduced to the following amounts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: <strong>$99</strong></li><li>Extended Pass: <strong>$199</strong></li><li>Professional Pass: <strong>$299</strong></li><li>All Access Pass: <strong>$499</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>In addition to the pricing changes, customers who purchased a pass between June 1st and August 1st are eligible for a refund. The refund is equal to the difference of the purchased price and the new price. Customers have until August 15th, to <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/support\">request a refund</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Customers who purchased passes before the reduction will have their renewal amounts automatically changed to the lower price. </p>\n\n<p>Pricing WordPress products and services is tough and requires experimentation. There are numerous <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=pricing\">WordCamp sessions</a>, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-price-a-product-wordpress/\">articles</a>, and <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/pricing-your-wordpress-services/\">in-depth guides</a> on the subject but there&#8217;s not one answer that&#8217;s best for every business. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly admitting to a pricing mistake is one thing, but offering refunds to try to get customers on equal footing is going the extra mile.</p>\n\n<p>The company could have handled things in a way that&#8217;s not as beneficial to customers, but they chose what I think is a commendable way. Williamson&#8217;s closing statement speaks about the way he leads his company and how he makes these types of decisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>While we are far from perfect, as this pricing mistake clearly indicates, we are dedicated to doing right by our customers.

Because of that strange sense of time and action I’ve always been quite fond of the quote from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland</p>\n<p>“Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”<br />\nBut where, for this story, is the beginning?</p>\n<p>It was a lifetime of choices and serendipitous encounters that led me down the path to WordPress and eventually Automattic. And those same types of choices and encounters that keep me here.</p>\n<h2>Begin at the Beginning&#8230;</h2>\n<p>I was a youngish mother of a youngish child and a full time stay at home parent. I didn’t work outside the home; I was raising my kid. That was both a privilege and a problem. I realized that, as a mother consumed with caring for this new human, I was beginning to lose the very strong sense of identity that I’d always had.</p>\n<p>This was my first experience with not knowing who I was. I always knew who I was, even if I didn’t know who I wanted to be. As a mother though, most of who I am was sucked into caring for my family. Not sleeping. Not taking proper care of myself. Not taking time for my interests. Putting the others in my house before me and saying that it was what I wanted.</p>\n<p><em>Narrator: It wasn’t.</em></p>\n<p>There was a pivot point. A moment before my daughter turned three. When I realized that if she were to choose to become a mother I would not want her to go down the same path of self denial that I had. I would want her to be who she is first and a mother second so that she could be the best self and mother she could be.</p>\n<p>And I realized that was something I could only show by example. But how to start? I’d always been a writer. I often say that I only learned to read so that I could write. Journaling, short stories, poetry. Sometimes just long strings of thoughts and observations that wouldn’t leave my head until I wrote them down. I would write out long “stories” on MySpace about my experiences and realizations. I would scrawl poetry on scrap paper laying around the house. None of it was enough.</p>\n<p>Also, as I understand is fairly typical for a stay at home parent, I had no one to talk to most of the time except for my small child. And while she was super awesome and receptive to any conversation I may want to start, they all tended to transition to discussion of My Little Ponies or a request for ice cream or screen time. So I looked for something more. For a place to discuss the mommified version of myself with no one and everyone. I started a blog.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Go On…</h2>\n<p>I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. My experiences, my kid’s experiences. Dreams and hopes and bad poetry. And I found a group of people who shared with me their struggles and dreams as they dove into mine. A web of women and men who got me. Who got what I was going through. Who got what I was doing. A community of individuals, not all like minded, but all understanding.</p>\n<p>And then one day I was asked to write for a city blog, and then another. And as my writing began to expand I found other communities. My sense of self was first preserved but then invigorated and it grew and I stretched my arms and I stretched my wings and I realized I was beginning to feel whole for the first time in a long while.</p>\n<p>But using multiple platforms for my blogging gave me the understanding that the platform I was using was restrictive and unsatisfying. Clunky.</p>\n<p>And that’s when a friend mentioned WordCamp Portland. It was this new thing. We were doing it for the first time. A bunch of bloggers getting together to talk about WordPress and blogging and stuff.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what WordPress was. But my friend said they needed some volunteers to help out, and I’m always one to support my friends, my community. So I asked what I needed to do to help.</p>\n<p>“Move your blog to WordPress”</p>\n<p>And so I did. And something clicked. Once I had moved to a WordPress site I found my passion for blogging was something more. I played with themes, I made headers that felt like art pieces, I helped others transfer their content, set up their sites. I introduced them to a community that I was just beginning to get to know.</p>\n<p>And then there was a cascade of activity. More blogs, podcasting, events, community, and every year there was WordCamp Portland. And I continued to learn and grow my skills as a writer, as a blogger, as a podcaster, and as a WordPresser. I continued to volunteer, and then to speak, and to help organize.</p>\n<h2>And on…</h2>\n<p>But life changes. Sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. But change is hard. People change or stay the same. Relationships change. Life changes. Sometimes all of the above. So I ended a marriage and found myself stumped. I knew who I was, but who I happened to be was a stay at home mom who hadn’t worked outside the home in eight years and had no marketable skills that I could find that would also allow me to continue to be home for my kid.</p>\n<p>And I panicked and I procrastinated and then I found an opening. A small startup I knew through my interactions with the community needed a customer support person who also knew WordPress.</p>\n<p>A light went on. And I had a job for the first time in eight years. And I knew what I was doing. And I was good at it. And I continued to blog. A little. And I stuck to the little tiny fringes of the WordPress community I knew. Still not realizing how big the rest of it was.</p>\n<p>The Portland WordPress folks were like a river feeding into the ocean of the worldwide community. But I’d only ever stood on the shores of the river and dipped my toes in. All that was about to change.</p>\n<h2>Till You Come to the End…</h2>\n<p>But as I said at the beginning, it’s not that simple. There is no end. There is just more. More stories, more people, more learning, more community. And that’s where we begin the part of the story that tells us where I am today.</p>\n<p>This part begins with an email from a community friend with a link to a job posting. And a new beginning.</p>\n<p>I was working happily at that small startup, spreading my wings. But starting to feel a little bit like my passion wasn’t being put to use when that email arrived. A link to a job posting working as a sponsored volunteer within the WordPress community and question. It was a simple question. “Do you know anyone who would kick ass at this job?”</p>\n<p>DID I? I was reeling from the possibility and doubled over with imposter syndrome and fear. Fear that I wasn’t good enough. Fear that they wouldn’t like me. Fear that I’d be leaving my boss in the lurch.</p>\n<p>So I did what I always did at that time. And what I still do to this day. I procrastinated. I talked. I thought. I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic thinking I had forgotten something. Thinking I had done something wrong.</p>\n<p>But as I sat there one day tinkering on the startup’s site, scheduling posts, checking in on our customers all while getting my daughter ready for school that morning I realized that it was time to set aside those fears. To look that imposter syndrome right in the eye and say “not today” and I started putting together my resume and working on the cover email.</p>\n<p>No one was more surprised than I when I found myself two months later starting my first day at Automattic.</p>\n<p>It’s been about 5 and a half years since that email landed in my inbox. It’s been more than a decade since WordPress landed in my heart and I’m proud to make my living in the wide wonderful world of WordPress. As I write this story for all of you to read—not a cautionary tale I hope, but an inspirational one—I’m just a few days away from the end of my three-month sabbatical (a benefit that all Automatticians are eligible for after 5 years.)</p>\n<p>It’s been a time of rest, readjustment, relaxation. Of edification. But it’s also been a renewal. A time to look back at how I got where I am and remember how lucky I am to be here today.

In April, the platform <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> sweeping changes to the publish_actions permission, which allowed apps to publish to users&#8217; timeline on their behalf.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On August 1st, 2018, the Live API publish_actions permission, which allows an app to publish on behalf of its Users, will be reserved for approved partners. A new permission model that allows apps to publish Videos to their User&#8217;s Groups and Timeline will be created instead.</p>\n<p>Access to the Pages APIs requires re-submission of the application for review before August 1, 2018. This will be required to continue publishing live and VOD video to Pages, as well as reading insights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook is notorious for swiftly changing its APIs in ways that break apps (sometimes without warning), often sending developers scrambling. For a long time, apps auto-posting to user timelines was part of the wild west of app permissions granted without much oversight from Facebook. Users often unknowingly gave permission to apps that would collect data and spam their Facebook connections with posts made on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Those days are over, but an unfortunate byproduct of this restriction is that apps like WordPress.com and Jetpack&#8217;s Publicize feature can no longer automatically publish posts to user timelines. This change also adversely affects apps like Buffer and Hootsuite that allow users to schedule and publish posts to their social accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2018/07/30/jetpack-6-3-3-facebook-publicize/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 6.3.3</a> removes the ability for users to select Facebook Profile connections and displays a notice regarding existing connections, so users will be aware of which auto-posting connections they are losing. Besides Jetpack, this Facebook API change affects tens of thousands of users who have this functionality implemented through one of many other plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Users are now required to manually share their posts to their timelines. They can no longer schedule content to be shared to Facebook at specific times for different audiences.</p>\n<p>Auto-posting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Pages</a> still works, and one option users have is to convert their Profile to a Page or set up a new page. This may not be a suitable alternative for bloggers and those whose writing is not attached to a business or an organization.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on his blog, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn off auto-posting to profiles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As it turns out, Facebook also is turning off the ability for WordPress sites — and all websites — to post directly to users’ profile pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The decision to shut down the API is ostensibly to fight propaganda and misinformation on the platform, but I think it’s a big step back for their embrace of the open web. I hope they change their minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If only a select few &#8220;approved partners&#8221; are allowed to automatically broadcast to user timelines, it puts smaller players at a disadvantage, requiring manual sharing each time they publish. Facebook is setting itself up as a gatekeeper that enables news from a small selection of partners to keep pumping through the platform on schedule. Individual voices on smaller websites are no longer able to syndicate to the Facebook platform unless they decide to create a Page.</p>\n<p>Put a different way, the only syndicated content allowed on Facebook will be through channels the company can monetize &#8211; business/organization Pages or partners who are approved to post to user timelines. Users who care about retaining their Facebook audiences will need to remember to manually post their content to the social network after August 1, 2018, when the API changes go into effect.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:11:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: My Recode Decode Interview with Kara Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1780:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We want to make the best tools in the world, and we want to do it for decades to come.

From his unique vantage point, Needham said he doesn&#8217;t think CMS rivalries are as big of a deal as they used to be.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re realizing that we&#8217;re really not competing,&#8221; Needham said. &#8220;The internet is a big place and there&#8217;s plenty of room for all of our communities to work together &#8211; especially since our values are so closely aligned already. If there is a rivalry, it feels a little bit more like a friendly sibling rivalry than anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 21:50:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Developers: Learn How to Convert Shortcodes to Gutenberg Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82737\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-developers-learn-how-to-convert-shortcodes-to-gutenberg-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2208:\"<p>Gutenberg contributor <a href=\"http://pento.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Pendergast</a> has published a handy <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pento/cf38fd73ce0f13fcf0f0ae7d6c4b685d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sample plugin</a> that demonstrates how to convert shortcode functionality to a Gutenberg block.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you have a bunch of shortcodes that you’d like to really easily turn into blocks?

The Gutenberg handbook has an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/theme-support/\">excellent article</a> on how to opt-in and add support for enhanced features.</p>\n\n<p>Most themes will present the default blocks without any issues as the blocks themselves provide their own styles. If you use a theme that does not fully support Gutenberg such as the Wide or Full Block Alignment options, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-support-for-gutenberg/\">Theme Support for Gutenberg</a> plugin may be for you. </p>\n\n<p>Created by <a href=\"https://weavertheme.com/about/\">Weweaver</a>, Theme Support for Gutenberg claims to allow most WordPress themes to be compatible with Gutenberg. In addition to theme support, the plugin adds a Classic Editor button to the admin bar to easily switch between Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n<p>Since a default WordPress theme is used to show how this plugin is beneficial, I decided to try it for myself. I installed the plugin on a fresh install of WordPress 4.9.7, Gutenberg 3.3, and the latest version of Twenty Sixteen. I published a Gutenberg Demo post which uses many of the default blocks.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Looks Better Without It<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Here is what the Gallery block looks like in Twenty Sixteen with the plugin disabled. The content looks good and fits within the content column.</p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Disabled\n\n<p>When the plugin is enabled, the images are so large, a horizontal scroll bar appears. </p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Enabled\n\n<p>The plugin includes additional styling for default blocks. One block that doesn&#8217;t benefit from the enhanced styles is the Video block. With the plugin disabled, the video block appears normally. </p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Disabled<br />\n\n<p>With the plugin enabled, the video block overflows the content column and breaches into the left sidebar.</p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Enabled \n\n<p>Although the plugin initially shipped with no options, version 0.2 includes new settings that provide better compatibility for some themes. I checked the box to disable Fitvids support which solved the video block issue. However, the other options had no effect on the oversized image blocks. <br /></p>\n\n<img />Theme Support Options\n\n<p>Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen do not work well with this plugin. There may be themes, particularly older ones that benefit, but more modern themes will likely be ok without it. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:42:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Virtual WooCommerce Conference to be Held October 18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82508\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-virtual-woocommerce-conference-to-be-held-october-18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4964:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woosesh-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a>, a new two-day virtual conference focused on WooCommerce topics, will be held October 18-19. While wrapping up another successful edition of WordSesh, Brian Richards announced WooSesh as the next event coming under the WordSesh brand. On Wednesday, nearly 500 attendees joined WordSesh. People tuned in from around the world, although the audience was heavily US-based due to the time the event was scheduled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wordsesh-july-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Since WooConf is not happening this year, WooSesh is an exciting alternative that will be accessible to anyone in the world. Co-organizers Brian Richards and Patrick Rauland will be hosting eight presentations each day, so the event will last between 8-10 hours both days, including breaks and announcements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we learned that WooConf wouldn’t be taking place this year we reached out to our friends at Automattic to see if we could work with them as well to still provide a high-quality event but for a much more global audience,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is sponsoring the entire event, making it free for all live attendees. Richards said they are working with other prominent companies in the WooCommerce space who are lending their knowledgeable staff as presenters, as well as providing the event with digital swag for attendees.</p>\n<p>WooSesh organizers are employing an interesting concept for encouraging attendance and engagement. The conference will have a $200 ticket price for those who do not attend live. Those who register in advance and attend live will receive the $200 ticket for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That means if a person joins the mailing list and shows up for the event, they’ll be able to experience the whole thing at no cost to them,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Similar to WordSesh, a ticket grants attendees access to the entire broadcast, chat, recordings, real-time transcriptions, and some cool digital swag. But with WooSesh they’ll also get some targeted follow-up content, and perhaps a private community, to further help them succeed and increase the impact of this conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I think it’s in everyone’s best interest to register and attend live – at least trying to make it to one of the sessions across the two days – so they can get all of that for free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said recordings may still make it out there for people to view afterwards but none of the other perks and follow-ups will be available without purchasing a ticket or attending live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We talked about asking people for a credit card up front and building a mechanism that would either charge them after the fact (like a pre-order) or charge them up-front but then refund them after the fact,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Instead we’re going with the simpler route and asking only for a person’s name and email address up-front. If they come to the live event they’ll be able to access all of the content afterwards just as if they had paid, and if they don’t attend live they’ll instead be greeted with a payment form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Building on their collective knowledge of organizing successful in-person and virtual conferences, Richards said he and his co-organizer wanted to reduce the friction as much as possible for people getting into their seats and engaged with the speakers and other attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it a virtual event already knocks down a ton of barriers,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Making the content available for free eliminates even more. Except that, people will often discredit free things and we didn’t want anyone to think of this content as any less valuable or serious than it really is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooSesh organizers plan to host compelling case studies, as well as talks about SEO, security, tips for building different kinds of e-commerce stores, and share advice from others’ hard-earned lessons. The event will also host sessions for developers that delve into WooCommerce architecture, performance, how to build and support custom extensions, and how to expand service offerings to better support e-commerce projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our biggest goal with WooSesh is that it will help store builders as well as coders to have more impact with what they build,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Specifically, we’d like to see them make some measurable progress in their own goals, whether that’s more sales, better customer experiences, greater depth of knowledge, or otherwise. We’re also hoping that some of these talks will inspire attendees to do more than they originally thought possible – either for their own e-commerce stores or for their customers/clients.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:34:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Slack Acquires HipChat, Moves Blog from Medium to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82681\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/slack-acquires-hipchat-moves-blog-from-medium-to-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2732:\"<p>Slack <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/atlassian-and-slack-partnership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it has acquired HipChat from Atlassian.

The open source vector icon font is used on more than <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Font-Awesome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">22 million sites</a> across the internet. It&#8217;s also a popular icon font with WordPress theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>Version 5.2 introduces automotive and education categories, which should be useful to fill the gaps for designers and developers creating sites around these subjects.

Thanks to its GPL-friendly license, the icon font is widely used in WordPress&#8217; theme and plugin ecosystem in both commercial and free products. Font Awesome&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Github issues queue</a> is also loaded with icon requests that would be used in niche WordPress themes, as well as icons for WordPress-related company logos.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Font Awesome announced the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/font-awesome-cdn-now-in-beta-loads-icons-asynchronously-with-automatic-accessibility-best-practices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta release of its new CDN</a>, which allows developers to implement it using a single line of code to bring the icons and CSS toolkit into their projects. At that time, Font Awesome was used by more than 300 plugins on WordPress.org. In 2018, searching the official plugin directory turns up more than 800 plugins that make use of the icon font in some way. Thousands of free and commercial themes also use it to provide users with easy customization options.</p>\n<p>Font Awesome support for Gutenberg is going to be fairly important, as hundreds of thousands of websites are using plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Font Awesome</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome Shortcodes</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-4-menus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome for Menus</a> to allow users to add icons to content and menus.

Users have access to a pre-populated media library but cannot upload images to the test site. It&#8217;s also not possible to create shared blocks or save the post. Attempting to save an action will trigger an &#8220;updating failed&#8221; notice. Apart from those few limitations, Frontenberg allows users to test nearly all of Gutenberg&#8217;s features.</p>\n<p>The tool was created by <a href=\"https://tomjn.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Nowell</a>, VIP Wrangler at <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>. He launched the frontend testing instance on his own website at <a href=\"https://frontenberg.tomjn.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">frontenberg.tomjn.com</a> and the WordPress VIP team built its own version to handle more traffic. Frontenberg contains links to numerous Gutenberg resources, including <a href=\"http://vipgutenberg.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vipgutenberg.com</a>, which has some free training videos the team created for VIP clients.</p>\n<p>Nowell has written a post called <a href=\"https://tomjn.com/2018/01/22/how-frontenberg-works/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How Frontenberg Works</a> for developers who are interested in the tech behind the tool.

In 2015, the Metadata UI project <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/\">was reborn</a> as the <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api\">Fields API</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Fields API was developed to allow registering fields to different screens in the admin area through a single API. New meta boxes and fields within them could be added to posts while new sections and fields could be added to the profile screen.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the API is to integrate with all of the various admin screens including, Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments and provide standardization.</p>\n\n<p>Clark has been leading the project for three years and despite seeing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-fields-api-project-sees-renewed-interest\">renewed interest</a> last year, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C04MWK7PZ/\">announced</a> in the project&#8217;s Slack channel that he is stepping down. <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is with a heavy heart that I must pass the torch on this project.

I believe so deeply that WordPress needs a Fields API, but the journey to where we are at with the Fields API has been long and arduous. </p><p>The truth is, I burned out years ago while building the first and second prototypes.

I still believe to be such a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future success.</p><cite>Scott Kingsley Clark</cite></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The Trials and Tribulations of Leading an Open Source Project</h2>\n\n<p>In the following interview, Clark explains why he feels personally responsible for the project&#8217;s lack of progress, why the API is important for WordPress&#8217; future, and reflects on what he could have done differently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you looking to pass the torch on to anyone in particular?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m not sure who would have the drive and the clout to see the project through. It&#8217;s a large scale project that should be approached with a long-term vision but in small enough increments to make it into WordPress core. It&#8217;s a lot to ask of somebody, it&#8217;s also not a priority for people right now since they are distracted by Gutenberg being released in the near future.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is the Fields API a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>People look at WordPress today and wonder how they ever survived without the REST API. Well, at least I know I do! The same thing can be said about the Fields API even though it&#8217;s not there yet. There are so many cases where it&#8217;s frustrating to build solutions for WordPress across all of the different hooks.<br /></p>\n\n<p>For consistency, it&#8217;s the wild west out there. You get a meta box registered and you fill it with whatever you want. You need your own CSS to style the form fields and everyone has their own idea of how this interface should look. You are in charge of your own responsive layouts that are mobile-friendly, there&#8217;s just so much you have to handle on your own. You should be able to customize appearances, but every place you want to add a field or form to should really have a proper API.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Long-term, imagine registering fields to WordPress like you register post types. Imagine fields and their configurations being available to the REST API and accessible through the WordPress App or other custom apps. </p>\n\n<p>The whole world opens up because you have a consistent API, the whole world make sense because you have a consistent interface for those fields across the various edit screens. Posts, terms, comments, users, media, even the Customizer would all have the same underlying API to add groups, panels, and fields to their screens.<br /></p>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg was done after the Fields API was in, migration for folks wouldn&#8217;t have been as difficult. Gutenberg could have automatically shown all of the Fields API interfaces like it does for the meta box backward compatibility. It would have looked so much nicer too.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking some time to reflect, what could you have done differently to get more core contributors to buy into the project and turn it into a higher priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure, it&#8217;s a delicate balance of taking input and being confident in the end result. At first, the feedback was about how the API was foreign for WordPress, they asked if it could be similar in structure to other APIs such as the Customizer. </p>\n\n<p>We scrapped the code and rebuilt from the ground up as a fork of the Customizer, it even supported having the Customizer utilizing the Fields API too. At the height of development, we had all areas of the Fields API implemented.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Core releases were moving pretty fast, there was a lot of code changes from WordPress release to release that we had to keep up with because we had essentially created a project that was a giant patch for WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>There weren&#8217;t enough hooks in place to do what we needed to do, and many sections were not extensible because of code decisions that marked themselves as &#8216;final&#8217;, which means you can&#8217;t extend a specific class to customize how it works.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I wish I could have been at all the big WordCamps in the US and Europe, essentially lobbying for this feature. Gathering supporters and such, it feels like politics in a way. I hung around in Core dev meetings, trying to bring it up. I tried to legitimize the feature by having a dedicated channel in the official WordPress Slack, posting updates on<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> https://make.wordpress.org/core/</a>, and holding weekly meetings.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I prioritized my time for development over the time to gather the troops. That was the downfall, I began to burn out quickly after the first few rewrites as I had many other responsibilities elsewhere on top of Fields API.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not like companies will easily want to pay you to work on a project like this indefinitely, even though both WebDevStudios and 10up gave me time to push it forward. It wasn’t a blank check, at some point I had to get back to billable work. From then on, it was all in my free time and that was difficult to manage during times of financial stress and house selling/buying.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s demand for a Fields API in core but not enough hands to build it. Why do you think that is?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Everyone is focused elsewhere. There’s a lot of areas of WordPress that need people’s attention. There are things like Accessibility that deserve a lot more attention than it gets. But the focus to me, seems to be on Gutenberg and REST API. </p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg especially has been a huge time sink for people contributing and people implementing. It’s a really large feature. It’s definitely larger in scale than Fields API, it’s like a whole new app that lives in WordPress. Integration with it has required a lot of education and trial/error. People’s focus is where it needs to be right now. It’s just unfortunate that Gutenberg came before Fields API in terms of priority and interest level.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to the next Fields API project leader?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>This is a big project, everyone will want to say it should be a certain way. You have to evaluate the options and put forth something bite sized for core to start with. Build upon that, but never lose sight of the long-term goal of integration across all of the WordPress screens. Even the front-end comment forms could thrive with the Fields API.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you feel personally responsible for the project not being a core priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>At one point, we had momentum. We had at least three to four people who were active. It fell apart because I ran out of time. It’s my shortsightedness, it’s my fault. I spent hundreds of hours developing the project over a couple of years. I should have left myself much more time for organizing the feature proposal text and keeping the fires burning in our contributors’ hearts.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Considering the time and effort you&#8217;ve put into the project the last few years, do you feel any sense of relief passing the torch on?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>If the torch gets passed or picked up, I will feel a ton better. The main relief is that it’s officially not a weight I have to carry alone any longer. It’s okay to try and fail, it’s still sad though. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that someone or some company steps up and puts time into this. They could even reignite the fire in my own heart that burned itself out. For now, I have one less major to-do item. I still have a hefty plate but it’s no longer as heavy of a burden.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<p>While the immediate future of the project is unclear, those interested in taking it over are encouraged to read posts marked with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API tag</a> on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">Make.WordPress.Core</a> to learn about its history.

Even before Chrome began flagging unencrypted sites, the search engine added <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HTTPS as a ranking signal in 2014</a>. It started as a lightweight signal that affected fewer than 1% of global queries.

With more sites adopting HTTPS as the norm, the company may choose to strengthen the signal in the future.</p>\n<p>Not everyone is comfortable with a for-profit company making an aggressive push to require websites to deliver content over HTTPS. Some fear that prioritizing encryption in search results, while also using Chrome to cast doubt on websites&#8217; security, is just the beginning.</p>\n<p>Dave Winer, one of Google&#8217;s most vocal critics regarding this initiative, sees the push towards HTTPS as <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the company&#8217;s attempt to take control of the open web</a>. His concern is that if Google succeeds, it might &#8220;make a lot of the web&#8217;s history inaccessible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Google makes a popular browser and is a tech industry leader,&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;They can, they believe, encircle the web, and at first warn users as they access HTTP content. Very likely they will do more, requiring the user to consent to open a page, and then to block the pages outright.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BTW, if I had to guess, the *real* reason Google hates HTTP has to do with Google\'s ad revenue, and not wanting Verizon and Comcast to remove their ads and replace them with their own. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61c.png\" alt=\"😜\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; scripting.com (@davewiner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1021500417241427968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others have speculated that another driving factor behind Google&#8217;s push for HTTPS adoption may be its investment in <a href=\"https://www.i-programmer.info/news/87-web-development/11367-google-starts-its-push-to-progressive-web-apps-bye-bye-chrome-apps.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advancing PWA technologies</a>, which require HTTPS to be enabled.

But in order to create these redirects, you have to go through the cluttered and sometimes slow post creation screen. All you really need to create a redirect is a title, a destination URL, and a local short URL.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now find a menu item &#8220;Add Page Link&#8221; that will allow you to quickly add a redirected Page without having to wait for the entire WordPress post editing interface to load. It&#8217;s <em>super</em> fast, and it doesn&#8217;t redirect you away from the screen you&#8217;re on.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Since short URLs are better for sharing (and remembering), the UI will give you a little push to shorten the URL if the one generated from your title is too long. From there, you can Save Draft or Publish.</p>\n<img />Hey, that URL is getting a bit long\n<img />Custom slug, for a better short URL\n<p>Additionally, this release includes a &#8220;link&#8221; indicator on post and page list screens, so you can easily see what items have been re-pointed with Page Links To.

In the past, WordSesh has been a marathon 24-hour event, but Richards decided to pare it down to 12 hours this year in order to organize the details quickly and get the next event on the calendar as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>WordSesh Experiments with Charging Attendees for Tickets, Adds Real-Time Transcription</h3>\n<p>For the first time in WordSesh history, the event is charging attendees for tickets (rather than making it free for everyone as in years past). Richards is using the ticket money to pay speakers and have every video professionally transcribed in real-time. He has received some pushback on the decision but wants to see how things fare with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the community might get behind that so we can stop asking speakers to completely volunteer their time, and the transcriptions are a huge accessibility bonus for non-native English speakers as well as the hard of hearing,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;There have been just a few people pipe up to voice their distaste that I converted a free event to a paid event, which suggests there are many others stewing about it quietly, and I’m guessing it’s because they don’t realize where the money’s going (not that it should matter in either case).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said tickets are dynamically priced to be the operational equivalent of $25 USD in every person&#8217;s home country. In India, for example, the ticket price is closer to $9 USD. He has kept quiet about the tech until now because he didn&#8217;t want people gaming the system but has since decided that it&#8217;s not a major concern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The site accounts for purchase power parity so that the cost is not more than a couple of billable hours (or, ideally, much less) for everyone,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;And for people whom the cost of a ticket is still a stretch, well, that’s where the scholarships come in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordSesh still has 18 donated scholarships to give away but Richards said he is struggling to find people willing to apply to watch the event for free. Prospective attendees can <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/product/wordsesh-scholarship/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">apply for a scholarship or nominate others to receive one</a>.</p>\n<p>A ticket to the event grants attendees access to the sessions, both live and after it has been recorded. Attendees will also receive virtual swag. A few samples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A steep discount on WPSessions annual memberships (33%)</li>\n<li>Stripe is providing an exclusive link to skip the invitation process on their Atlas program and cover the cost for processing their first $5k of payments</li>\n<li>CorgiBytes is offering a $1k discount (~20%) on their code auditing services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous WordSesh events averaged 1,000 online attendees and a good portion of them showed up the same day the events aired. This year there are approximately 400 registered so far. Richards said he won&#8217;t rule out the possibility of making the event free again for the next edition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Asking more from sponsors could make a free event possible again without paying for everything personally (right now I&#8217;m still about $1000 in the red), but I really want to put the onus on the community at large,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Quality events take a lot of time and effort to accomplish, and most of that cost is on the backs of the organizers, speakers, and sponsors rather than attendees (at least in the WP community). Having been in all of those seats I&#8217;d really like to see more responsibility shift to the attendees. I would personally be happy to pay more for an event and be glad knowing that both speakers and organizers weren&#8217;t burning all this time in hopes of a return.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Virtual conferences have started gaining more traction in the global WordPress community after the success of previous WordSesh events. WordPress educator Zac Gordon recently hosted more than 1,000 attendees at his free <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/free-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-to-stream-live-friday-june-29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for WordPress conference</a> in June. The Polyglots&#8217; virtual <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Global WordPress Translation day</a> has also attracted hundreds of participants at each event (448 attendees in April 2016, 780 attendees in November 2016, and 1,300 local event RSVPs in September 2017).</p>\n<p>Virtual events often reach far more people than an average local WordCamp, and many also inspire in-person meetups. Watch parties for WordSesh&#8217;s 5th edition are happening in cities across the globe, including Antwerp, Lagos, Minneapolis, Mumbai, and Bar Harbor (Maine).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve always enjoyed seeing people pour in to the event each year, and there was a delightful hum throughout the WordPress community every time a WordSesh took place,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WordSesh has been a valuable addition to the virtual event space around WordPress, and attendee numbers at the upcoming event will be important for measuring how much traction the event can retain with its conversion to a paid event. Richards says he is committed to keeping the event alive and hopes to host it two times per year, which is one of the reasons for cutting it back to 12 hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m already excited for the next event,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;I’m a little concerned at the moment, only because I don’t expect this one will sell enough tickets to break even, but I’m absolutely committed to hosting WordSesh again in the future.

Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan with a population of more than 30 million people. Its airport connects the country to other international cities and smaller cities within Pakistan are available by rail or bus. Organizers behind the camp are overcoming a rocky history that has plagued the planning of WordPress-related events in the country for the past several years.</p>\n<p>At the close of 2015, Pakistan was on track to host its first WordCamp in Lahore, building on momentum from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-growing-in-pakistan-500-attend-lahore-meetup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenal growth of the local meetup group</a>. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/xpertone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muhammad Kashif</a>, one of the organizers, was averaging 200-500 attendees at meetups and his team&#8217;s application to host <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-pakistan-application-approved-for-2016\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Lahore was approved for 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The meetup events, which attracted young students, developers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, had grown so large that Kashif was having to close registration ahead of time because they were exceeding the capacity of the venue. Organizers expected 400-500 attendees at the WordCamp before it was cancelled after several delays near the end of the planning stage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-pakistan-wordpress-meetup-featured.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After contacting the WordPress Community team for the reason why it was cancelled, I received an official response from representative Hugh Lashbrooke:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes a WordCamp doesn’t make it all the way from pre-planning to being an actual event — occasionally due to logistical challenges, but other times because of broader concerns. In this case, once the WordCamp planning was underway, some tense dynamics arose within the local team. Everyone worked really hard to reach a positive solution, but we weren’t able to move forward with the event in the end.</p>\n<p>Cancelling an event is never anyone’s preference, to be clear, but it is also a customary response when it’s clear that collaboration isn’t possible in the short term. Local organizers are always encouraged to reapply as soon as the barriers to collaboration have been resolved.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lashbrooke also cited issues with the camp&#8217;s budget for the venue organizers selected. He said the situation was thoroughly investigated before the camp was cancelled and that they would never take that kind of decision lightly.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Lahore organizers gave me a different report on what happened and were disappointed with the decision from the Community Team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Representatives from the Foundation cancelled the camp in the last stage based on a complaint from one person out of a community of 3,000 people,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;The Foundation made a direct decision of cancellation without giving me a chance for explanation as the Primary Organizer. I suggested the Foundation conduct a survey from the whole Lahore community to know the facts but they had already made the decision to cancel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif claims there was no disagreement between the organizers, because the community member in question, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrahmadawais\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ahmad Awais</a>, was never part of the original organizing team.</p>\n<p>One member of the planning team agreed to speak to me anonymously about why he believes the camp was canceled. He claims that Awais fractured the team after his request to be given a prominent position in the organization was denied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ahmad Awais started hijacking Kashif and his team,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was not a lead organizer at all, but on the planning team. Instead of contributing, Ahmad wanted to speak at every meetup and didn’t spend time with organizing team. He broke the team and started pointing fingers at Kashif and the existing organizing team. He was NOT there until WC Lahore was approved. He joined the team after that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple leaders from WordCamp Karachi&#8217;s 14-person organizing team, who wish to remain anonymous, have reported that Awais also requested to be named keynote speaker and was unhappy with the team after they told him that speaker decisions do not work like that. Several said they feared his retaliation against the camp, given they previously had no recourse with the Community Team after the experience of WordCamp Lahore getting shut down.</p>\n<p>Awais is not attending WordCamp Karachi and has declined to answer any questions about WordCamp Lahore due to personal reasons.</p>\n<p>Kashif received hundreds of messages from the community after the event in Lahore was cancelled. He had been working since 2013 to bring a WordCamp to the area. He said that while the Community Team was helpful with other queries he had, he was disappointed with how quickly the camp was cancelled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I worked tirelessly for years to get a WordCamp to Lahore and grew the community from 430 to 2600 in one year but the Foundation didn’t even give me a chance to explain before canceling WC Lahore, Kashif said. &#8220;I am a bit disheartened by that action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif is now helping with other WordCamps, including Karachi and NYC. He is also willing to work to re-establish a WordCamp Lahore in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like me there are lots of other WordPress enthusiasts in Pakistan who want to participate in WordCamps but not everyone can do that outside of Pakistan due to financial or visa reasons,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;I was accepted as a volunteer in WordCamp Europe but couldn’t join due to visa issues. I have seen so much excitement for WordCamp Karachi in the WordPress community across the whole country. Everyone is willing to help to make it a successful event so that there are more frequent WordCamps in Pakistan. The first one is so important as it will set expectations of outcomes of a WordCamp for people who are new to these events.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Karachi Organizers Aim to Make a Positive Impact on Pakistan</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Karachi organizers are attempting to move past the Pakistani WordPress community&#8217;s checkered history of contention. They are also eager to distance themselves from the conflict that took down WordCamp Lahore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/usmankhalid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Khalid</a>, lead organizer of the camp, said he has put in a lot of effort asking organizers and volunteers to work together, regardless of the credit they will receive, and focus on the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to spend time on having a positive impact for this country, avoiding any kind of noise,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;The Pakistani WordPress community is vibrant in many ways. We have around 6,000 plus WordPressers in our community, with people who are selling their products and services worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Khalid said there are many users in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawer, and Faisalabad who are doing well with WordPress but are not yet connected to the community or participating in meetups and events. People from all over Pakistan will be attending the event as their first exposure to the WordPress community. Sessions will mostly be conducted in English but a few will be mixed with Urdu, the regional language.</p>\n<p>Khalid has experienced many growing pains in bringing the event to a community that is new to understanding how WordCamps work. In a country that is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pakistan-is-blocking-sites-hosted-on-wordpress-com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notorious for its censorship</a>, WordPress&#8217; mission of democratizing publishing has the potential to change many lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since this is first Wordcamp, many people even don&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;Those who know want to be a speaker, or any lead role that can promote them. When we tell them it doesn&#8217;t work like this, they are mostly get annoyed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tech publications around Pakistan have not been exposed to WordCamps either. Khalid said several of them have asked for money in order to cover the story of the event, unaware that the purpose of the camps and meetups is not to translate everything into business but to give back to the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am simply working to actually deliver first and prove that this community can create a positive impact,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;I am sure after Wordcamp Karachi, the entire community within Pakistan will flourish, regardless of what happened in Lahore.&#8221; He said he hopes the next camps will be even more interesting in the future and that WordCamp Karachi will help to create new jobs and more businesses in Pakistan.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:14:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: Why the makers of Ninja Forms are getting into eCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=46627\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/why-the-makers-of-ninja-forms-are-getting-into-ecommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1982:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

WordPress 4.9.7 increased the number of times it calls the wp_is_stream() function generating the error more often.</p>\n\n<p>After thoughtful conversations within the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532#comment:46\">trac ticket</a>, a patch was created that after further testing, was committed to core. ﻿<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532#comment:46\">According to Gary Pendergast</a>, the patch does the following.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n	<p>Bailing if the path isn&#8217;t a stream. This isn&#8217;t perfect: it&#8217;s still possible to trigger the PHP bug, but it does significantly reduce the chances of the bug being encountered. For many WordPress sites (those that don&#8217;t have plugins that use streams), it reduces the chance to zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you encountered memory exhaustion errors after installing or upgrading to WordPress 4.9.7, try <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/19/wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2/\">WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2</a> to see if it fixes the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from coming up with a solution, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44532\">Trac ticket #44532</a> is a bit refreshing to see. In open source, tickets or issues can get bogged down with suggestions, hypothetical scenarios, and bike-shed commentary.</p>\n\n<p>In this instance, the issue was identified and folks from the community along with core contributors worked together in a focused fashion to create a fix in time for the next point release.

The page counter wouldn&#8217;t increment.</p>\n\n<p>When a cookie banner is clicked a cookie is set in the browser so the website knows this visitor has agreed to accept cookies. If the cookie is set then the cookie banner html is not sent to the browser.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the main issue is that the code that sets and checks if the cookie is set is PHP. Unfortunately because the page is cached then no PHP code is executed, and the cookie banner is displayed because it was originally cached that way.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Since WP Super Cache only knows about certain WordPress cookies it assumes everyone who doesn&#8217;t have those cookies is a first time &#8220;anonymous&#8221; visitor. It doesn&#8217;t know about your cookie banner cookie.<br /></p>\n\n<p>You have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Rewrite your cookie banner so it&#8217;s completely in Javascript. Do the cookie detection in Javascript and also set the cookie in Javascript. If the cookie banner has been clicked then you need to trigger an action, and other Javascript that is hooked on to that trigger will run and load the tracking cookies.</li>\n	<li>Modify WP Super Cache so it knows about the cookie your cookie banner uses. Caching won&#8217;t work quite as well as before as it&#8217;ll be split between visitors who have clicked the cookie banner and those that haven&#8217;t. One cached file will display the cookie banner, and the other will not but it will have ad tracking Javascript.<br /></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Using Javascript completely is a better solution because it runs in the browser on every page load but that might not be possible every time.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, use PHP to get WP Super Cache to play nicely with your existing code:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>You&#8217;ll need to write a <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2017/10/25/writing-wp-super-cache-plugins/\">WP Super Cache plugin</a>.</li>\n	<li>You need to hook into the wp_cache_get_cookies_values cacheaction and add the value of the cookie banner cookie to the end of that string.</li>\n	<li>Caching can only be performed by <em>simple</em> caching now, unless you&#8217;re willing to edit mod_rewrite rules in your .htaccess file.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Something like this will do. Make sure you note the warning about <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> in the link above about writing these plugins.<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function add_cookie_banner_to_cache_cookie( $string ) {\n    if ( isset( $_COOKIE[\'cookie_banner\'] ) ) {\n        $string .= \'cb,\';\n    }\n    return $string\n}\nadd_cacheaction( \'wp_cache_get_cookies_values\', \'add_cookie_banner_to_cache_cookie\' );</code></pre>\n\n<p>Substitute the name of the cookie for your cookie name, change the name of the function, and the text it adds to the string. There is an intentional PHP fatal error in the code above to discourage copy/pasting.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Your cookie banner plugin could automate setting this up, but it may have unforeseen consequences if not done correctly. It should check if <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> is set already, and use that location, otherwise it will have to make a directory and update the WP Super Cache configuration, where ABC is the new location for the plugins.<br /></p>\n\n<p><code>wp_cache_setting( \'wp_cache_plugins_dir\', ABSPATH . \'wp-content/ABC\' );﻿</code></p>\n\n<p>The new code can be copied into a file in that directory. The files in the original WP Super Cache plugins directory (found at <code>WPCACHEHOME . \'plugins\'</code>) should be copied into that directory too and a warning shown to the user. They may need to set up one of those plugins again.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The reason it is this convoluted is because this code will run before all of WordPress loads. You can&#8217;t rely on blog options or most of the nice configuration tools WordPress provides.<br /></p>\n\n<p>When your plugin is uninstalled it should of course restore the plugins directory to the way it was before.</p>\n\n<p>For future reference, since cookie banners will hopefully not be around forever, here&#8217;s what they looked like in the deep, distant past of 2018. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n	The LA Times just gave up and don&#8217;t show anything to EU visitors.\n\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n\n<img />\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2003/08/12/linuxie-and-free-software-projects/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Linux.ie and free software projects\">Linux.ie and free software projects</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/03/06/please-sir-can-i-have-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Please sir, can I have more?\">Please sir, can I have more?</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/2018/07/20/wp-super-cache-and-cookie-banners/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 13:33:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: First Look at “Try Gutenberg” Prompt in WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-try-gutenberg-prompt-in-wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3384:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/19/wordpress-4-9-8-beta-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.9.8 Beta 2</a> was released today, featuring the new &#8220;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Try Gutenberg</a>&#8221; prompt that will appear in user dashboards when the official release drops at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>The prompt invites users to install Gutenberg if they want to try the new editor or install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> to keep using the current editor until they are ready to make the change. WordPress contributors discussed variations on the design and wording of the callout and finally settled on what you see in 4.9.8 Beta 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-4.02.56-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Even if users don&#8217;t get involved in Gutenberg testing, the callout serves to inform them that the new editor will be enabled by default in the next major release of WordPress.

If your clients&#8217; installations are not ready for users to act on the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt, now is the time to install a plugin that will disable it. Clients with free-range of the WordPress admin, in sites that are running Gutenberg-compatible extensions, are better candidates for testing the new editor.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-classic-editor-addon-plugin-disables-the-try-gutenberg-prompt-coming-in-wordpress-4-9-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor Addon</a> is one option that will suppress the prompt and automatically suppress Gutenberg when it ships in WordPress 5.0. It was also recently updated to auto-install the Classic Editor plugin as a dependency so users don&#8217;t have to install two plugins as part of the process.</p>\n<p>A release candidate is slated for July 24, and the official 4.9.8 release is scheduled for July 31st. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg plugin</a> is currently sitting at 10,000+ active installations and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> at 5,000+.

Whereas in Spain, for example, they had 11 WordCamps this year that are more local and smaller. As a German community we are more used to traveling to a central place and meeting there.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What to Expect at WCEU in Berlin: A Diverse Community, More Workshops, and a Unique After Party</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.estrel.com/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Estrel Hotel and Congress Center</a> will host the entire event, including both conference days, the contributor day, and the after party. Although the venue has a max capacity of 12,000 people, Kau said organizers are planning for 2,500 &#8211; 3,000 attendees. The local team is excited to introduce the European WordPress community to their home city.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Berlin is one of the most diverse cities in Europe,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;When I prepared the application, I figured out that there are people from 191 countries living in Berlin. It&#8217;s a very international, very diverse city, so you can be just as you are and feel quite comfortable and welcome in Berlin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kau said organizers intend to continue with workshops as a part of the event in 2019 but they are planning to make the signup experience more efficient.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was the first year we tried workshops,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;We had three workshop tracks and workshops of 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and three hours. We are not sure how many workshops we want to have in Berlin. The idea was new but turned out quite well. There were workshops with many people waiting to get in and from what I&#8217;ve heard it was quite good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kau said he wants to improve the process for workshops, because there was no easy way for attendees to sign up and managing waiting lists was a lot of manual work for the content team.

If you&#8217;re never in the presence of other people they can&#8217;t hit you. Retreat becomes so easy. Marius Jensen from Sola, Norway grew up in a society that did not care for him, and made him want to hide from the world forever.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community gave him a safe place to talk to people online, and after time, in person. WordCamps became a place of safety and compassion. This isn&#8217;t the case for all people, but it is for many people, in many places.

The plans are finely tuned around the company&#8217;s products and come with free SSL certificates. <br /></p>\n\n<p>I reached out to Cory Miller, Founder of iThemes to figure out why they&#8217;ve entered the hosting space, what it means to be able to control the user experience of their products from the top-down, and how their plans compare to those from hosts that offer Jetpack Premium. </p>\n\n<h2>Interview With Cory Miller<br /></h2>\n\n<p><strong>What does it mean for you and iThemes to be able to control the user experience from the top-down?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In short, it means a better overall experience for our customers. For more than 10 years, we’ve dealt with most of the hosts, especially the ones offering catered WordPress offerings, and it has been a terribly frustrating experience for us trying to troubleshoot problems and help our mutual customers. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we’ve long said you have to have two things to be our customer: WordPress and web hosting. Now we install WordPress for you, along with SSL, essentially with a click on our own hosting. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you compare iThemes hosting packages to hosts that offer Jetpack Premium services as part of their plans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The thing that sticks out for me is having everything under one brand and team. But we think using iThemes Sync Pro as the hosting control panel gives us a significant edge for our customers to do more with their WP sites, in particular, our reporting features in Sync Pro. </p>\n\n<p>Now our customers can get WP backups, security, site management and in-depth reporting all from one dashboard, along with their hosting. With our Business plan, they get BackupBuddy, our WordPress backup plugin; iThemes Security Pro, our WordPress security plugin &amp; iThemes Sync Pro all in one. Plus they get an awesome team of WordPress pros for support if they need help or have any issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are you most looking forward too offering these hosting packages specifically tuned for iThemes products and WordPress?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The actual implementation of the vision of offering the key essentials we think people want and need, along with a roadmap to do more, from our team at iThemes. It was one of the motivators for joining the Liquid Web family — the ability to finally do what we’ve always wanted to do for our customers, offering a more complete experience for them, from us. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Were there any challenges that you overcame when putting these packages together?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The main one that comes to mind is trying to ensure we offer what people actually want and will buy. But there was several months of hard work by our team and others to get this launched. Some long nights to pull all the pieces together in order to do this, with many more to come.</p>\n\n<p>Prices range from $15 per month to $25 per month billed on an annual basis. New customers can take advantage of a coupon code <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/2018/07/17/announcing-ithemes-hosting/\">on the site</a> to purchase the Business plan, normally $25 for $15. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 23:19:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Custom Product Tables Plugin Now in Beta, Boasts 30% Faster Page Loads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82363\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-plugin-now-in-beta-boasts-30-faster-page-loads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3615:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/woocommerce-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce is celebrating <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/birthday-sale/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10th years of Woo</a> this week. Over the past several years WooCommerce has grown to become a dominant player among e-commerce solutions on the web. <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/shop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">E-commerce Usage Distribution stats from BuiltWith</a> currently rank WooCommerce as the most commonly used platform for stores in the top 1 million sites.</p>\n<p>Performance and scalability were the main focuses for the WooCommerce development team last year and these issues continue to be top priority. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.0</a>, released in April 2017, included significant performance improvements when WooCommerce switched from post meta to taxonomies for features like product visibility, featured products, and out of stock products. It also introduced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) classes for developers, making it easier to write and retrieve data from the database with less code.</p>\n<p>Building on the CRUD work done last year, WooCommerce has just <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-beta/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the beta of its new Custom Products Tables plugin. It replaces the WooCommerce product Data Store with new, dedicated product tables for significant reductions in page load time across shop, checkout, and admin pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The results, so far, have been great – with improvements of up to 30% on page load times!&#8221; WooCommerce engineer Gerhard Potgieter said. &#8220;Checkout, arguably the most important part of the store experience, has seen the biggest performance gains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WooCommerce development team tested the plugin&#8217;s impact on performance using two identical stores running the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/storefront/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a> theme and no additional plugins. They created a data set of 500 products using the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-smooth-generator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Smooth Generator</a>, and both stores had 70,000 orders in the database and meta data in the range of 1.4 million rows.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woocommerce-load-times.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/woocommerce-custom-product-tables-beta/\">WooCommerce Development Blog</a>\n<p>The Custom Product Tables plugin is not ready for use in production but developers can <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-product-tables-feature-plugin/releases\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">download version 1</a> and test it against <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.5 dev</a> (switch to the master branch).</p>\n<p>Getting the plugin rolled into WooCommerce core is an exciting update on the horizon, as faster page loads generally improve conversion for store owners. WooCommerce engineers anticipate releasing the plugin on WordPress.org as the next step. They plan to include the new product tables in a major version update early next year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 20:20:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Feature Plugin Adds Support for Progressive Web Apps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82311\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-plugin-adds-support-for-progressive-web-apps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5800:\"<p>WordPress contributors are working on getting support for Progressive Web Apps (PWA) into core.

Google describes them as having the following three qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reliable – Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions</li>\n<li>Fast – Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling</li>\n<li>Engaging – Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin adds support for technologies that PWAs require, including Service Workers, a Web App Manifest, and HTTPS. These technologies support functions like background syncing, offline content, push notifications, mobile home screen icon, and other PWA features.</p>\n<p>XWP CTO Weston Ruter said the purpose of the feature plugin is to curate PWA capabilities for proposed merging into core. The idea is to merge them piece by piece. Core tickets are already in process for adding support for <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43328\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">web app manifests</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36995\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support for service workers</a>, as well as bringing <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28521\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">improvements to HTTPS</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This PWA feature plugin is intended to equip and facilitate other plugins which implement PWA features,&#8221; Ruter <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2018/07/12/wceu-2018-recap-amp-and-pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;It’s not intended to negate any existing plugins with these features, but rather to allow such plugins (and themes) to work together seamlessly and expand upon them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first release of the plugin on WordPress.org (v0.1.0) adds support for web app manifests and initial support for allowing theme and plugin developers to register scripts for service workers via <code>wp_register_service_worker()</code>. It also includes an API for detecting whether HTTPS is available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A next step for service workers in the PWA feature plugin is to integrate <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Workbox</a> to provide a declarative WordPress PHP abstraction for managing the caching strategies for routes, with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/pwa-wp/issues/5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support for detecting conflicts</a>,&#8221; Ruter said. Anyone who is interested to contribute to PWA support for WordPress can check out the discussions and <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/pwa-wp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugin on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>In the past, app-like experiences were only available for sites and services that had their own native mobile apps, but native apps can be costly to develop and maintain. Progressive web apps use the greater web as their platform and are quick to spin up. They make content easier to access on mobile even without an internet connection. It&#8217;s also far easier to tap a home screen icon than to enter a URL on mobile, and this makes users more likely to engage with their favorite sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pwastats.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA Stats</a> is a site that features case studies of progressive web apps that have significantly increased performance, engagement, and conversion. A few compelling examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tinder <a href=\"https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cut load times from 11.91 seconds to 4.69 seconds</a> with their new PWA. The PWA is 90% smaller than Tinder’s native Android app. User engagement is up across the board on the PWA.</li>\n<li>Grand Velas Riviera Maya resort <a href=\"https://blog.milestoneinternet.com/industry-news/milestone-boosts-website-conversions-by-53-with-progressive-web-apps-pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased its Black Friday conversion rate by 53%</a> due to its progressive web app’s speed and notifications.</li>\n<li>Trivago saw an increase of 150% for people who add its PWA to the home screen. Increased engagement led to a <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/consumer-insights/trivago-embrace-progressive-web-apps-as-the-future-of-mobile/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">97% increase in clickouts to hotel offers</a>. Users who go offline while browsing can continue to access the site and 67% continue to browse the site when they come back online.\n<li>Pinterest rebuilt their mobile site as a PWA and <a href=\"https://medium.com/dev-channel/a-pinterest-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-3bd6ed2e6154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core engagements increased by 60%</a>. They also saw a 44% increase in user-generated ad revenue and time spent on the site has increased by 40%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PWA support in WordPress will enable the plugin and theme ecosystems to work together in providing site owners with more engaging ways to connect with their visitors. Once the market starts building on core support, site owners should soon be able to offer better experiences for mobile users without having to become experts in the technologies that power progressive web apps.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 00:16:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Dev Blog: Quarterly Updates | Q2 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6140\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/07/quarterly-updates-q2-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15621:\"<p><em>To keep everyone aware of big projects and efforts across WordPress contributor teams, I&#8217;ve reached out to each team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/\">listed representatives</a>.

In addition to Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unveiling a roadmap for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core</a>, a strong contingent of designers and engineers from the team were present to educate attendees on Gutenberg&#8217;s architecture and the vision behind the project.</p>\n<p>Many attendees were visiting Serbia for the first time and Belgrade delivered with its renowned hospitality and captivating nightlife. Attendees found no shortage of delicious options for food and drink.</p>\n<h3>Berlin to Host WordCamp Europe 2019</h3>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, organizers announced Berlin as the next host city for <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe, June 20-22, 2019</a>. The conference, Contributor Day, and the after party will all be held at the <a href=\"https://www.estrel.com/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Estrel Hotel and Congress Center</a>, a venue with a capacity for 12,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>Organizers said that Berlin&#8217;s accessibility, reasonable prices, and strong community were the final deciding factors for its selection as the next host city.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Behind the Scenes at WordCamp Europe 2018 with Lead Organizers Jenny Beaumont and Milan Ivanović</h3>\n<p>Hosting a volunteer-led event at this scale requires an enormous amount of effort from the organizers, especially those taking the lead for multiple years in a row. There is nearly no down time as the team is already planning for the next edition of the camp.</p>\n<p>I sat down with lead organizers Jenny Beaumont, the global lead, and Milan Ivanović, the local lead, to get a look behind the scenes at what is involved in bringing WordCamp Europe to thousands of WordPress enthusiasts in one weekend. We <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-to-be-held-in-belgrade-serbia-june-14-16\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> them at the conclusion of WCEU 2017 in Paris. Over the past two years these leaders have developed a strong working relationship built on encouraging each other and keeping a positive outlook for their teams.</p>\n<p>Beaumont said she was hesitant going into a third year for this role, as Paris was the project that captured her heart and motivation. After going through this event as the global lead, she said she discovered what she could bring to the role and how she could serve the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The event has been their project,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;My project this year has been the team, how I can really concentrate on this team, on its growth, on its health, on its sustainability. That&#8217;s what I learned in Paris &#8211; the importance of making sure that was part of the project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beaumont and Ivanović explained the difference between the global and local lead roles, a structure that works well for flagship WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The local team is really about making it a good experience in this new place that everybody is going to be discovering for the first time,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the hard work, it&#8217;s the logistics, it&#8217;s all of the small details, everything that&#8217;s behind the scenes that make it so you walk in as an attendee and it just feels like you&#8217;re at home. They do all of that hard work. The global role, as it has evolved, is really about being that sort of team care-giver, making sure that there is good communication happening, making sure the team is healthy and happy and motivated. Because you&#8217;ve got to get up and do this every day while you&#8217;re also doing your day job, and that takes a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe had a strong impact on the local community with more than 400 Serbian attendees and 20 Serbian organizers. They worked to build awareness of WordPress in the local community ahead of the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We used this event to grow our community and used our community to promote the event,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;When we announced last year in Paris that Belgrade is going to be next, at that time we had five or six cities for WordPress meetups. Currently, we are in 14 cities and starting the 15th in July. WordCamp Europe and the conference itself was such a win for the whole community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ivanović will return next year as the global lead for WCEU in Berlin. Beaumont is taking some time off after three years organizing WordCamp Paris and WordCamp Europe, but she hopes to return in some capacity in the future. They are working together with their team to publish a WordCamp Europe handbook that covers some of the important specifics of the event for upcoming teams.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a> theme is now available on WordPress.org with minimal styling and seamless support for all core content and media blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/atomic-blocks-screenshot.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The theme allows users to control the width of the content area to create full-screen posts and pages. It supports full-screen images, videos, and galleries, showcasing the new editor&#8217;s wide alignment styles for content. Atomic Blocks includes Customizer options for uploading a logo, customizing the font style, setting body and title font sizes, and selecting an accent color.</p>\n<p>Check out the theme&#8217;s demo to see the blocks in action: <a href=\"https://preview.arraythemes.com/atomicblocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://preview.arraythemes.com/atomicblocks</a>.</p>\n<p>The theme also seamlessly supports McAlister&#8217;s new Atomic Blocks project, a collection of page-building blocks included in the accompanying <a href=\"https://atomicblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks plugin</a>. It currently includes blocks for creating a post grid, call-to-action, testimonials, inline notices, sharing icons, author profiles, accordions, customizable buttons, drop caps, and spacer/dividers, with many more blocks planned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/testimonials-block.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew Gutenberg was going to be a game changer from the second I saw it and started hashing out product ideas in October 2017,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;To me, it felt like a very natural evolution and transition for WordPress into a more forward-thinking content creator. All of the tools outside of WordPress are evolving and becoming better and easier to use and WordPress is starting to feel quite dated in comparison.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister said his team is building Atomic Blocks into a full-fledged content block solution that will include a commercial version in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a long list of blocks that we’ll be releasing into the plugin in the coming months — everything from eCommerce to email marketing to full-page layouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There will definitely be a commercial version of the plugin for those extra awesome blocks that will take your site to the next level.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister is keeping Atomic Blocks separate from Array Themes but plans to cross promote between the two. He also plans to update the Array themes collection to support the blocks found in the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Atomic Blocks aims to solve a different problem in a different way than the traditional WordPress themes you’ll find on Array,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;By launching it separately from Array Themes, it gave me the opportunity to diversify my projects a bit and create a dedicated marketing stream for a Gutenberg solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many products in the Array Themes catalog are already working with the new editor, but McAlister and his team intend to provide more in-depth support for specific Gutenberg features in themes where appropriate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve stayed fiercely committed to beautiful design, simplicity, and core coding standards and practices to ensure wide-spread support and compatibility with our themes,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;While this has served us well, we are all ready for a core-supported solution to providing a better experience for our customers. Gutenberg will solve this problem by providing a cohesive, unified way of extending content creation with a core user interface. Gutenberg is quite extensible as is, and will only grow more capable with time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister said one of the most challenging aspects of launching Atomic Blocks has been keeping pace with Gutenberg&#8217;s rapid development, requiring the team to follow multiple conversations across various WordPress core development discussion channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I followed Gutenberg development closely during the second half of last year and then started developing Atomic Blocks for Gutenberg early this year,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;You have to follow the Github repo, Make blog posts, and Slack conversations closely to keep up with the changes, deprecations, and feature additions. Luckily, now that features are being frozen, the code is churning less and things are starting to stabilize.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to keep up with all the news and changes, McAlister started the <a href=\"http://gutenberg.news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg News</a> site to collect helpful resources, tutorials, and code snippets he found. The site contains more than 200 links to resources for both beginners and developers.</p>\n<p>McAlister predicts that Gutenberg will bring a greater separation between the roles of themes and plugins in the site-building experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The demand for themes will certainly begin to change more drastically in the long term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Traditional WordPress themes will still be desirable for a number of years, simply due to the number of sites out there and the solutions needed to build them. Eventually, much of what can be provided by a theme will be provided by blocks via a plugin instead. Themes will still be responsible for providing a degree of styling and functionality that will remain critical to the site-building experience, but they will take a secondary role to content blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg will inevitably change the landscape of the theme industry, but McAlister sees it as a chance to reach customers in a new way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Theme designers and developers should be excited about this opportunity and not feel threatened by Gutenberg,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;This is a fantastic opportunity to learn a new set of skills, attract a new segment of customers, and start pivoting to a block-based product model.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 22:33:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 323 – Recap of WordCamp Grand Rapids and A Gutenberg Road Map\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=82285&preview=true&preview_id=82285\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-323-recap-of-wordcamp-grand-rapids-and-a-gutenberg-road-map\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2142:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> recaps his trip to WordCamp Grand Rapids and shares his experience.

The gateway was previously available as a beta plugin and could be enabled on a per-site basis but is now available to all WordCamps.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/moving-wordcamp-ticket-sales-from-paypal-to-stripe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposing Stripe as the default payment gateway</a> in April, Hugh Lashbrooke cited the fact that PayPal is entirely blocked and inaccessible in some countries. He also identified Stripe&#8217;s simpler UI and larger number of supported currencies as its chief advantages.</p>\n<p>PayPal has been the default for years on WordCamp websites but it currently supports only 26 currencies. Stripe supports 136 currencies, allowing WordCamp organizers to offer ticket purchases in more places than before. Previously, some communities were forced to build a local gateway integration to sell WordCamp tickets via PayPal, requiring those sales to be inconveniently funneled through a local bank account. The Stripe gateway option is a welcome update to support WordPress&#8217; growing international community, which held camps in 73 countries in 2017.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Stripe isn&#8217;t fully replacing PayPal. The Camptix plugin allows organizers to activate multiple payment gateways for cases where one or both make more sense, retaining the flexibility to support ticket sales at camps with different payment requirements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 18:02:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: Translating For Love\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2587\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://heropress.com/translating-for-love/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=translating-for-love\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3006:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/092816-vladimir_petkov-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I started translating WordPress so that my seven-year-old daughter can share her personal stories.\" /><p>We all have our reasons for the things we do. Money, love, orders, etc. Vladimir Petkov started using WordPress because it solved a problem. As the years went by it continued to solve problems, and he continued to use it. His time to give back didn&#8217;t arrive until much later though.</p>\n<p>His 7 year old daughter wanted a blog, and WordPress wasn&#8217;t completely translated into her language. So Vladimir learned how to translate WordPress, so his little girl (and every other Bulgarian speaker) can use their voice to speak to the world.</p>\n<p>Why do you give back to WordPress?

Core design contributors are currently working on a few new iterations of the callout. They are also considering including a section inside the prompt with an option to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin in preparation for Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Developers and agencies have time to install the Classic Editor on client sites that are not ready for Gutenberg, but this will not prevent users from seeing the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt. <a href=\"https://gschoppe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Schoppe</a>, one of Gutenberg&#8217;s most outspoken critics, partnered with <a href=\"https://so-wp.com/plugin/classic-editor-addon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pieter Bos</a> to develop a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor-addon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor Addon</a> that changes how the Classic Editor plugin works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For agencies supporting many sites, whose users have no way of knowing whether Gutenberg will break their site or not, this nag screen is a danger,&#8221; Schoppe commented on our most recent Gutenberg update. &#8220;Pre-emptively installing Classic Editor unfortunately won’t suppress the nag notice either, but since Classic Editor is being used as a bellwether of the success of Gutenberg, it’s important that you install it, if you expect issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schoppe co-wrote the Classic Editor Addon to solve this problem. It suppresses the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt and when the new editing experience ships in 5.0, it will automatically suppress Gutenberg as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Classic Editor plugin doesn&#8217;t remove Gutenberg by default, the addon plugin sets the option to fully replace Gutenberg. It also removes the Classic Editor&#8217;s options from the Settings > Writing screen. Schoppe said he believes this is what the Classic Editor plugin should have done out of the box, instead of requiring the user to find the settings screen to replace Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Installing both the Classic Editor and Classic Editor Addon on tens or hundreds of client sites could be time consuming, so Schoppe suggests using a site management dashboard, such as MainWP, ManageWP, or Jetpack, to bulk install both plugins for clients.</p>\n<p>According to stats on WordPress.org, Gutenberg is active on more than 10,000 sites and the Classic Editor is active on 4,000+ sites. The &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt is expected to go out in WordPress 4.9.8, which is targeted for the end of July. The goal for the prompt is to make users aware of the plugin and get more testers involved before Gutenberg lands in WordPress 5.0.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 22:35:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Post Status: Working on your own website — Draft Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=46462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/working-on-your-own-website-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1619:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it — the tiny minority that went to sea, for example — immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature. I find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the outlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Present outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers. One thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The finding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area?</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities? (Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it. Any design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. —<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><i>SB</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">[/full_width][two_fifth padding=\"10px 10px 10px 10px\"]</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Loose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island. For society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">For the individual it serves as an always possible</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back. For evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness is the preservation of the world.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out. Depending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers — the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If we run out of that resource, can </span><span class=\"s1\">we synthesize it, or intentionally </span><span class=\"s1\">preserve it?

Wells was talking to a bunch of them on April 18,1980, at the National Technical Conference, Earth Sheltered Building Design Innovations, Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma City. As follows. (See also Wells\' book.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground Designs, p. 240, and How to Buy Solar Heating without Getting Burnt, p. 189.) -SB</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s pretty satisfying to cover a building with earth and then watch the utility bills shrink.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the roof doesn\'t leak — or collapse — the temptation to congratulate oneself is at times almost irresistible. Just think: natural shelter from all extremes of heat and cold, shelter made of ordinary on-site subsoil, a material not yet thought to be in very short supply. It\'s satisfying to live and work underground, too, satisfying in more ways than that of energy saving.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\'s the silence, the security, the in-tune-ness you feel, not to mention the reduced outdoor maintenance costs, so those of us in the earth-shelter business tend to lose our perspectives just as easily as anyone else. We get smug. We think we have found The Solution. The fact that earth-shelter has almost no measurable effect upon The Problem is swept away by our ovro self-satisfaction. The Problem is something a bit wider than anything earth-sheltered buildings alone can hope to solve. Most descriptions of it go something like this:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nuclear war,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nuclear accidents,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starvation/overpopulation</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the growth of deserts,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toxic materials in the environment,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> loss of topsoil,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the proliferation of pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> destruction of the ozone layer,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> increasing concentrations of atmospheric COj,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> overpaving,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the depletion of natural resources,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> genetic manipulation,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the extinction of species,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> habitat destruction, etc., etc., all the way down to an</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exploding crime rate, and</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inflation.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are, in other words, in a colossal mess, the scale of which is so vast there appears, in statistical terms, to be Httle hope of our correcting it before life itself — certainly every higher form of life — disappears.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet there is  hope.

So what, if we build half a million earth-sheltered buildings by the year 2000? How many of the other kind will we have built during the same period? So what, if we built ten million  earth-sheltered buildings?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or a hundred million? If the world situation is 80% hopeless right now, all our underground efforts during the next generation could at best improve it to, say, 79.6% hopeless, unless  we can take some sort of giant leap forward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not meant to be discouraging. My intention is to make us see our work in proper perspective, to show us how terribly important it is that we commit ourselves to doing our best — and then some —  not only in earth shelter and solar heating but in the way we practice every facet of architecture and in the way we live each moment of our lives. Each of us will talk to hundreds of other persons this year. If what we say to them is, in effect, nothing more than an earth-covered version of what we\'ve always said we\'U get nowhere. To build underground simply to save fuel in order to go on living just as we did before is a perversion of a potentially good idea.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to catch fire with a dream.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to see, and tell others about, a future world almost as beautiful and as timeless as the one we just destroyed. (Two hundred years to erase a continent-wide wilderness was not a very long time.) We\'ve got to practice sky-mining instead of earth-mining. And we\'ve got to get back in tune with the nature song, the one that goes something like this...</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilderness was not just one of, say, a dozen wholly different responses to the physical environment and resources here on earth. The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well.

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it—the tiny minority that went to sea, for example—immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature.\r\nI find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the\r\noutlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"\r\n[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]\r\nPresent outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers.\r\nOne thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The\r\nfinding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area? In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities?\r\n(Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it.\r\nAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. -SB\r\n\r\nLoose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area\r\nThe specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island.\r\nFor society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.\r\nFor the individual it serves as an always possible alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back.\r\nFor evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness Is the preservation of the world.\"\r\nIt\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out.\r\nDepending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers—the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.[/two_third_last]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span>', 'Apocalypse juggernaut, hello!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '39-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-13 20:45:33', '2018-01-13 20:45:33', '', 39, 'http://localhost/wpp3/39-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it—the tiny minority that went to sea, for example—immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature.\r\nI find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the\r\noutlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"\r\n[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]\r\nPresent outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers.\r\nOne thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The\r\nfinding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area? In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities?\r\n(Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it.\r\nAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. -SB</span>\r\n\r\nLoose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area\r\nThe specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island.\r\nFor society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.\r\nFor the individual it serves as an always possible alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back.\r\nFor evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness Is the preservation of the world.\"\r\nIt\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out.\r\nDepending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers—the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[/one_fourth_last]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span>', 'Apocalypse juggernaut, hello!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '39-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-13 20:47:23', '2018-01-13 20:47:23', '', 39, 'http://localhost/wpp3/39-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In sober scientific circles today, there is hardly a subject more commonly discussed than man\'s control of his own heredity and evolution. And the discussions seldom leave much doubt that man will acquire this control. It is a matter of when, not if. The late Dr. J. B. S. Haldane, always intrigued by the bizarre, wrote in 1949: \"If King Charles I\'s or King Louis XVI\'s head had been stuck within a minute or so [after their executions] on a pump which supplied oxygenated blood to it, it would almost certainly have come around, after half an hour or so, enough to open its eyes and move its lips, and would probably have recovered consciousness.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that if I have an inoperable cancer this experiment will be tried on me.\"</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could anyone ever replace a dead-but-frozen ruler?

With life so overabundant and so easy to produce anew, why should anyone want to go to all the trouble and expense of reviving all that competition?

This has brought it about that the work and thought of Bjckminster Fuller is of prime importance to me.

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it—the tiny minority that went to sea, for example—immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature.\r\nI find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the\r\noutlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"\r\n[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]\r\nPresent outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers.\r\nOne thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The\r\nfinding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area? In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities?\r\n(Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it.\r\nAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. -SB</span>\r\n\r\nLoose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area\r\nThe specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island.\r\nFor society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.\r\nFor the individual it serves as an always possible alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back.\r\nFor evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness Is the preservation of the world.\"\r\nIt\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out.\r\nDepending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers—the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[/one_fourth_last]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span>', 'Apocalypse juggernaut, hello!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '39-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-14 19:08:01', '2018-01-14 19:08:01', '', 39, 'http://localhost/wpp3/39-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

When two competing organisms coexist in the same geographical region, close examination always shows that they are not complete competitors, that one of them draws on a resource of the environment that is not available to the other. The corollary of the principle is that where there is no geographical isolation of genetically and reproductively isolated populations, there must be as many ecological niches as there are populations. The necessary condition for geographical coexistence is ecological specialization. Darwin\'s life is symbolic.

So what, if we build half a million earth-sheltered buildings by the year 2000? How many of the other kind will we have built during the same period? So what, if we built ten million  earth-sheltered buildings?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or a hundred million?

My intention is to make us see our work in proper perspective, to show us how terribly important it is that we commit ourselves to doing our best — and then some —  not only in earth shelter and solar heating but in the way we practice every facet of architecture and in the way we live each moment of our lives. Each of us will talk to hundreds of other persons this year. If what we say to them is, in effect, nothing more than an earth-covered version of what we\'ve always said we\'U get nowhere. To build underground simply to save fuel in order to go on living just as we did before is a perversion of a potentially good idea.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to catch fire with a dream.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to see, and tell others about, a future world almost as beautiful and as timeless as the one we just destroyed. (Two hundred years to erase a continent-wide wilderness was not a very long time.) We\'ve got to practice sky-mining instead of earth-mining. And we\'ve got to get back in tune with the nature song, the one that goes something like this...</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilderness was not just one of, say, a dozen wholly different responses to the physical environment and resources here on earth. The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well. It seems virtually certain that no other response to the earth environment can last very long. Whatever we do, it\'s got to be pretty much like what natural systems are. For proof of this, look around you; everything out of step with those systems is already in trouble.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoveling dirt onto a building is not exactly what I mean by getting back into step with natural systems. They\'re so complex that billions of observers over thousands of years have so far failed to understand them all. Shoveling dirt onto a building is but one tiny step toward a whole earth architecture no one has yet even begun to conceive: A lot more of those tiny steps have got to be taken before we can say we\'ve taken one big one. And the steps must be danced to the nature tune or they will continue to be nothing more than steps taken backward. The natural world is  the way. All we can do is mimic it, use it, grope for its principles, and hope there\'s still time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\'t have the slightest idea what happens to make an egg turn into a man, or a man into compost, or compost into plant substance, or plant substance turn into an egg, but I do know that that\'s the way this particular world happens to work. I have a superficial view of such metamorphoses but as to what really goes on I haven\'t a clue. All I know is that a miracle is at work all around me, and inside of me, every minute of the day. All lean hope to do for it is to stay out of its way, to let it happen with as little interference as possible, and to try to do better each time I fall,.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way I could live in perfect harmony with the natural world would be to throw away my credit cards, my clothes, my toothbrush, my Blue Cross, my vitamins, my house, my car — everything — and walk off into the bush, naked, ready to win or lose on my cunning alone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With luck, I might last as long as two days, so I\'ve got to find another way to Uve successfully, and that\'s what architecture should be all about: trying to compromise with nature, trying to find alternative ways of life compatible with the right way, the naked-in-the-wilderness way. If we still had a wild instinct we might find them a lot faster, but we traded that instinct for a brain, and so must think our way along, step by step.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have neither the time nor the inclination to study natural systems in any detail. I\'m nowhere near smart enough anyway. I\'ve got to keep it simple. That\'s why I developed the diagram above.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s my simplified version of all the things natural systems always do, arranged in such a way that I can rate the things / do in contrast to them. Admittedly, it\'s highly subjective and very unscientific, but even when I cheat badly in favor of myself the damning message is still there. If the score comes out plus, I\'m going forward; negative, back. It\'s not as easy as it sounds; almost every building that you and I have ever seen earns a negative score on this scale. The exceptions: a few — an extremely few —  really well thought out solar and wind-powered buildings, some wilderness shelters, and perhaps the huts of primitive people far from civilization. Your house, my house. New York City, your favorite building — aU are deep in the red; disasters.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about Oklahoma State University for a moment. What was the land like before the buildings and lawns covered it? Was it healthier then? Where does all the rainwater go now? Where does the food come from? Is sunlight used to run the university? Then where does its energy come from? At what cost? Where do all the wastes go? Do these buildings respond to natural cycles, to the seasons? Where is all the wildlife? Would you want to live here all your hfe? Is a bitter windy day — or a blazing hot one — tempered or intensified by the architecture of this campus? Is OSU beautiful? Does it please the eye the way a natural landscape does? Or is it simply a collection of architectural ego trips?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\'s Oklahoma State University on the wilderness values scale: Imagine: a large and well-endowed seat of learning in a state which depends upon healthy land for much of its income, earning a destructively negative score on a scale of life values any eighth grader could understand That score, that minus-850 score, is the central, overriding fact about OSU. It is the grinding truth about all the OSUs in America, and about the civilization that continues to produce them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do we see, most of us, when we visit this campus? We don\'t see disaster. We see the home of a big football team, or we see wide lawns, brick buildings, and another generation of young Americans being educated. How can we dare call ourselves expert at anything until we can see the central truth about what it is we\'re all doing?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where land is healthy and all creatures are in tune with it, plants — living green plants — cover almost every inch. They do everything that architecture — even earth-sheltered architecture — does not do. Plants manage the soil resource, giving us food and fuel and oxygen, collecting rainwater for earth storage, preventing erosion, reusing all wastes, providing wildlife habitat, responding to the seasons, offering us shelter, and creating the stunning panoramas we flee cities to enjoy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architects are professional destroyers of plants. We\'re taught to be. We set aside green areas only grudgingly, after all building requirements have been met, when in any but a sick society architecture would start with plants, if only out of enlightened self-interest, start with concern for their health and the health of the land, and then see if a building or a road or a bit of mowed lawn would cause an unacceptable level of damage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we ever manage to get ourselves around to that way of thinking we may even begin to have some impact upon The Problem itself. The big one.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an important message, to all who pass, from any truly appropriate architectural response to a site, not so much from the actual, physical good being done by the building as from the signals it broadcasts. When a building is appropriate and beautiful  we don\'t even need wilderness scales to tell us it\'s right. It can show us — and say to the hungry world all around — that those wasteful, unthinking Americans have finally begun to change. That\'s when we can start to have real hope for the future again, for once a good idea is set loose in the world its power can be greater than that of a thermonuclear bomb.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows in the hillsides will signal the reemergence of both a healthy land and a healthy people — if  the buildings behind those windows are truly in tune with the nature song. What could be better for us than to work toward the dream of flowering cities, of orchard towns, of villages in the wildflowers? What could be better than an</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">architecture that did all that, and more? If we push earth-shelter hard, push it far beyond itself, make it chmb far up the charts of the wilderness values scale, then and only then will we have begun to discharge our responsibilities as earthpeople, and to help get the world out of its mess.</span>', 'The Absolutely Constant Incontestably Stable Arquitectural Value System', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '99-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-01-14 19:11:22', '2018-01-14 19:11:22', '', 99, 'http://localhost/wpp3/99-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

So what, if we build half a million earth-sheltered buildings by the year 2000? How many of the other kind will we have built during the same period? So what, if we built ten million  earth-sheltered buildings?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or a hundred million? If the world situation is 80% hopeless right now, all our underground efforts during the next generation could at best improve it to, say, 79.6% hopeless, unless  we can take some sort of giant leap forward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not meant to be discouraging. My intention is to make us see our work in proper perspective, to show us how terribly important it is that we commit ourselves to doing our best — and then some —  not only in earth shelter and solar heating but in the way we practice every facet of architecture and in the way we live each moment of our lives. Each of us will talk to hundreds of other persons this year. If what we say to them is, in effect, nothing more than an earth-covered version of what we\'ve always said we\'U get nowhere. To build underground simply to save fuel in order to go on living just as we did before is a perversion of a potentially good idea.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to catch fire with a dream.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to see, and tell others about, a future world almost as beautiful and as timeless as the one we just destroyed. (Two hundred years to erase a continent-wide wilderness was not a very long time.) We\'ve got to practice sky-mining instead of earth-mining. And we\'ve got to get back in tune with the nature song, the one that goes something like this...</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilderness was not just one of, say, a dozen wholly different responses to the physical environment and resources here on earth. The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well. It seems virtually certain that no other response to the earth environment can last very long. Whatever we do, it\'s got to be pretty much like what natural systems are. For proof of this, look around you; everything out of step with those systems is already in trouble.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoveling dirt onto a building is not exactly what I mean by getting back into step with natural systems. They\'re so complex that billions of observers over thousands of years have so far failed to understand them all. Shoveling dirt onto a building is but one tiny step toward a whole earth architecture no one has yet even begun to conceive: A lot more of those tiny steps have got to be taken before we can say we\'ve taken one big one. And the steps must be danced to the nature tune or they will continue to be nothing more than steps taken backward. The natural world is  the way. All we can do is mimic it, use it, grope for its principles, and hope there\'s still time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\'t have the slightest idea what happens to make an egg turn into a man, or a man into compost, or compost into plant substance, or plant substance turn into an egg, but I do know that that\'s the way this particular world happens to work. I have a superficial view of such metamorphoses but as to what really goes on I haven\'t a clue. All I know is that a miracle is at work all around me, and inside of me, every minute of the day. All lean hope to do for it is to stay out of its way, to let it happen with as little interference as possible, and to try to do better each time I fall,.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way I could live in perfect harmony with the natural world would be to throw away my credit cards, my clothes, my toothbrush, my Blue Cross, my vitamins, my house, my car — everything — and walk off into the bush, naked, ready to win or lose on my cunning alone.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With luck, I might last as long as two days, so I\'ve got to find another way to Uve successfully, and that\'s what architecture should be all about: trying to compromise with nature, trying to find alternative ways of life compatible with the right way, the naked-in-the-wilderness way. If we still had a wild instinct we might find them a lot faster, but we traded that instinct for a brain, and so must think our way along, step by step.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have neither the time nor the inclination to study natural systems in any detail. I\'m nowhere near smart enough anyway. I\'ve got to keep it simple. That\'s why I developed the diagram above.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s my simplified version of all the things natural systems always do, arranged in such a way that I can rate the things / do in contrast to them. Admittedly, it\'s highly subjective and very unscientific, but even when I cheat badly in favor of myself the damning message is still there. If the score comes out plus, I\'m going forward; negative, back. It\'s not as easy as it sounds; almost every building that you and I have ever seen earns a negative score on this scale. The exceptions: a few — an extremely few —  really well thought out solar and wind-powered buildings, some wilderness shelters, and perhaps the huts of primitive people far from civilization. Your house, my house. New York City, your favorite building — aU are deep in the red; disasters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about Oklahoma State University for a moment. What was the land like before the buildings and lawns covered it? Was it healthier then? Where does all the rainwater go now? Where does the food come from? Is sunlight used to run the university? Then where does its energy come from? At what cost? Where do all the wastes go? Do these buildings respond to natural cycles, to the seasons? Where is all the wildlife? Would you want to live here all your hfe? Is a bitter windy day — or a blazing hot one — tempered or intensified by the architecture of this campus? Is OSU beautiful? Does it please the eye the way a natural landscape does? Or is it simply a collection of architectural ego trips?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\'s Oklahoma State University on the wilderness values scale: Imagine: a large and well-endowed seat of learning in a state which depends upon healthy land for much of its income, earning a destructively negative score on a scale of life values any eighth grader could understand That score, that minus-850 score, is the central, overriding fact about OSU. It is the grinding truth about all the OSUs in America, and about the civilization that continues to produce them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do we see, most of us, when we visit this campus? We don\'t see disaster. We see the home of a big football team, or we see wide lawns, brick buildings, and another generation of young Americans being educated. How can we dare call ourselves expert at anything until we can see the central truth about what it is we\'re all doing?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where land is healthy and all creatures are in tune with it, plants — living green plants — cover almost every inch. They do everything that architecture — even earth-sheltered architecture — does not do. Plants manage the soil resource, giving us food and fuel and oxygen, collecting rainwater for earth storage, preventing erosion, reusing all wastes, providing wildlife habitat, responding to the seasons, offering us shelter, and creating the stunning panoramas we flee cities to enjoy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architects are professional destroyers of plants. We\'re taught to be. We set aside green areas only grudgingly, after all building requirements have been met, when in any but a sick society architecture would start with plants, if only out of enlightened self-interest, start with concern for their health and the health of the land, and then see if a building or a road or a bit of mowed lawn would cause an unacceptable level of damage.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we ever manage to get ourselves around to that way of thinking we may even begin to have some impact upon The Problem itself. The big one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an important message, to all who pass, from any truly appropriate architectural response to a site, not so much from the actual, physical good being done by the building as from the signals it broadcasts. When a building is appropriate and beautiful  we don\'t even need wilderness scales to tell us it\'s right. It can show us — and say to the hungry world all around — that those wasteful, unthinking Americans have finally begun to change. That\'s when we can start to have real hope for the future again, for once a good idea is set loose in the world its power can be greater than that of a thermonuclear bomb.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows in the hillsides will signal the reemergence of both a healthy land and a healthy people — if  the buildings behind those windows are truly in tune with the nature song. What could be better for us than to work toward the dream of flowering cities, of orchard towns, of villages in the wildflowers? What could be better than an</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">architecture that did all that, and more? If we push earth-shelter hard, push it far beyond itself, make it chmb far up the charts of the wilderness values scale, then and only then will we have begun to discharge our responsibilities as earthpeople, and to help get the world out of its mess.</span>', 'The Absolutely Constant Incontestably Stable Arquitectural Value System', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '99-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-14 19:12:36', '2018-01-14 19:12:36', '', 99, 'http://localhost/wpp3/99-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In sober scientific circles today, there is hardly a subject more commonly discussed than man\'s control of his own heredity and evolution. And the discussions seldom leave much doubt that man will acquire this control. It is a matter of when, not if. The late Dr. J. B. S. Haldane, always intrigued by the bizarre, wrote in 1949: \"If King Charles I\'s or King Louis XVI\'s head had been stuck within a minute or so [after their executions] on a pump which supplied oxygenated blood to it, it would almost certainly have come around, after half an hour or so, enough to open its eyes and move its lips, and would probably have recovered consciousness.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that if I have an inoperable cancer this experiment will be tried on me.\"</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[/one_half][one_half_last]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could anyone ever replace a dead-but-frozen ruler? As billions of people were frozen in every generation, the dead might ultimately own al! the property and h6ld all the important offices. Barring the return of some sort of ancestor worship or a cult of the dead, would the unfrozen population put up with it? With life so overabundant and so easy to produce anew, why should anyone want to go to all the trouble and expense of reviving all that competition? Those piled-up frozen corpses might in fact be fiercely resented. If the planet became desperately overpopulated, with prevailing undernourishment and contempt for life, their very presence might even encourage a drift toward cannibalism. \"There is no doubt,\" says Richard R.

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it—the tiny minority that went to sea, for example—immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature.\r\nI find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the\r\noutlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"\r\n[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]\r\nPresent outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers.\r\nOne thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The\r\nfinding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area? In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities?\r\n(Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it.\r\nAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. -SB</span>\r\n\r\nLoose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area\r\nThe specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island.\r\nFor society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.\r\nFor the individual it serves as an always possible alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back.\r\nFor evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness Is the preservation of the world.\"\r\nIt\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out.\r\nDepending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers—the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[/one_fourth_last]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span>', 'Apocalypse juggernaut, hello!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '39-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-14 23:17:23', '2018-01-14 23:17:23', '', 39, 'http://localhost/wpp3/39-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Sim, um por cento! O que nos obriga a perguntar se esse “progresso” e “sucesso” terá realmente acarretado algum benefício para a nossa existência.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Será a nossa necessidade de progresso tão profunda e pragmática que não permite que nos possamos aperceber de algo tão amplo e precário como o espaço e o tempo que nos rodeia e, sobretudo, de que não temos, neste vasto e grandioso cenário, o papel principal?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bastaria ler os jornais ou escutar as notícias na televisão para tomarmos consciência de uma necessidade profunda de mudança, de alteração de hábitos e, essencialmente, de repensar e alterar a maneira de estar e de viver no planeta. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Todavia, habituados como estamos a uma ideia de supremacia da nossa espécie, acabamos por esquecer que nunca poderemos escapar à força que realmente governa o planeta, à força que nos permite aqui permanecer: a </span><span class=\"s2\">natureza</span><span class=\"s1\">! Foi através dela que evoluímos, que deixámos de “rastejar” para nos erguermos e sermos o que hoje somos. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contudo, pouco ou nada lhe temos dado em troca. Nem mesmo o respeito mínimo exigível.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tudo isto quando sabemos que o planeta não é nosso nem é a nossa casa. É, sim, um local em que fomos convidados a entrar, onde partilhamos um pequeno espaço, bem no telhado da casa, à superfície terrestre. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Como agentes de partilha e como convidados, temos de nos interrogar sobre se faz ou não sentido toda a nossa evolução e sobre os caminhos já percorridos e aqueles que podemos ou devemos tomar.

One evening after dinner i was telling friends that I was now concerned with improving the world. One of them said: I thought you always were. I then explained that I believe — and am acting upon — Marshall McLuhan\'s statement that we have through electronic technology produced an extension of our brains to the world formerly outside of us. To me that means that the disciplines, gradual and sudden (principally Oriental), formerly practiced by individuals to pacify their minds, bringing them into accord with ultimate reality, must now be practiced socially — that is, not just inside our heads, but butside of them, in the world; where our central nervous system now is. This has brought it about that the work and thought of Bjckminster Fuller is of prime importance to me.

In the 1970’s the world will undergo famines — hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate, although many lives could be saved through dramatic programs to ‘stretch” the carrying capacity of the earth by increasing food production. But these programs will only provide a stay of execution unless they are accompanied by determined and successful efforts at population control. Population control is the conscious regulation of the numbers of human beings to meet the needs, not just of individual families, but of society as a whole.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Nothing could be more misleading to our children than our present affluent society. They will inherit a totally different world, a world in which the standards, politics, and economics of the 1960’s are dead. As the most powerful nation in the world today, and its largest consumer, the United States cannot stand isolated. We are today involved in the events leading to famine; tomorrow we may be destroyed by its consequences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Remember also that in virtually all underdeveloped countries, people have gotten the word about the better life it is possible to have. They have seen colored pictures in magazines of the miracles of Western technology. They have seen automobiles and airplanes. They have seen American and European movies. Many have seen refrigerators, tractors, and even TV sets. Almost all have heard transistor radios. They know that a better life is possible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">They have what we like to call ‘rising expectations.’ If twice as many people are to be happy, the miracle of doubling what they now have will not be enough. It will only maintain today’s standard of living. There will have to be a tripling or better. Needless to say, they are not going to be happy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A ship has hit the rocks and is sinking. The passengers scream for help. Some jump overboard and are devoured by the circling sharks. A group of distinguished scientists is on board. One of their number suggests that they can help man the pumps. ‘Oh, no!” shout the others. ‘That might hurt the captain’s feelings. Besides, pumping is not our business. It’s outside our field of competence.’ You can guess what they do. They appoint a committee to Study the problem, with subcommittees on marine engineering and navigation. They announce to the passengers that In two or three years the committee will produce a wonderful report which will be acceptable to the passengers, the captain, and the steamship line. Not so passive are the politicians.

We got the power, here comes the responsibility. Whether you prefer to embrace it, or flee it (some should, for safeguard), or stay trembling where you are, you might as well have some detailed idea of what’s looming. This book, by the Science Editor at LIFE, does good journalism on three spooky areas: Refabrication of the Individual; Exploration of Prenativity; Control of the Brain and Behavior. Hypothesis: changes this radical outdistance the laws but not the economy. Control diminishes for governments and increases for consumers. The outlaw area of rapid change. Witness dope. <span class=\"s1\"><i>—</i></span> SB</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Coming: The control of life. All of life, including human life. With man himself at the controls.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Also coming: a new Genesis — The Second Genesis. The creator this time around — man. The creation — again, man. But a new man. In a new image. A whole series of new images. What will the new images be? They have to be quite different from the images we have known — the images that have led us to Vietnam, to turbulent racial conflict, to nuclear confrontation, to the threat of a polluted and overpopulated planet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">But all these things have come about — have they not? — with man at the controls, more or less. If he is acquiring awesome new powers — and he is — with immeasurably greater controls, does this not accelerate us all, at uncountable G\'s, toward the inevitable Dead End — a hundred bangs, followed by three billion whimpers? If we believe so, yes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">But man\'s new images may offer us surprising alternatives. Their creation will require the energetic projection of the best minds of the race to the farthest reaches of their imaginations. Futile effort? Anything but. What we believe about man, what we want for man, will profoundly influence what actually happens to man. What would you like: Education by injection? A catalog of spare body parts? A larger, more efficient brain? A cure for old age? Immortality through freezing? Parentless children? Custom-ordered body size and skin color? The ability to convert sunlight directly into energy, just as plants do, without utilizing food as an intermediary? Name it, and somebody is seriously proposing it. In sober scientific circles today, there is hardly a subject more commonly discussed than man’s control of his own heredity and evolution. And the discussions seldom leave much doubt that man will acquire this control. It is a matter of when, not if.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Could anyone ever replace a dead-but-frozen ruler? As billions of people were frozen in every generation, the dead might ultimately own all! Barring the return of some sort of ancestor worship or a cult of the dead, would the unfrozen population put up with it? With life so overabundant and so easy to produce a new, why should anyone want to go to all the trouble and expense of reviving all that competition? If the planet became desperately overpopulated, with prevailing undernourishment and contempt for life, their very presence might even encourage a drift toward cannibalism. “There is no doubt,” says Richard R. Landers “that machines as a group will dominate man as a group, and eventually, individual machines will dominate individual men.”</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The Second Genesis', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '87-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-01-15 04:21:08', '2018-01-15 04:21:08', '', 87, 'http://localhost/wpp3/87-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Enrico Fermi once said that a scientist should change fields every 10 years; that, in the first place, his ideas were exhausted by then, and he owed it to the younger men in the field to let them advance; and that, in the second place, his ideas might still be of great value in bringing a fresh viewpoint to a different field.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Why should someone not make us a single suit that would shed rain and that we could ruffle up for comfort in any weather, as a bird ruffles its feathers?

At the Marine Biological Laboratories at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where I have spent several summers, the boundaries between the generations seem to disappear, as well as the boundaries between work and play and between indoors and outdoors and between man and environment. Children and students and teachers walk barefoot in and out of the laboratories, arguing science and studying the odd creatures brought up from the sea. All night they watch the fish embryos developing in the dishes, and they go out before dawn together to catch the big striped bass. The 4-year-olds solemnly examine frogs, the 10-year-olds sell their catch of dogfish to the labs, the 15-year-olds listen to the DNA arguments on the beach or play savage tennis with the senior scientists.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As perception theory now suggests, each of us stands at the creative, choosing focus of a moving web of past antecedents and future consequences that branch out from our present choices and actions, propagating and amplifying themselves indefinitely. We interpenetrate the universe; it responds to our every breath.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">It seems to me that the new rights for which a demand is arising in our time, I think in an irresistible way, revolve primarily around the right not to be treated as an object.

So what, if we built ten million  earth-sheltered buildings?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or a hundred million?

My intention is to make us see our work in proper perspective, to show us how terribly important it is that we commit ourselves to doing our best — and then some —  not only in earth shelter and solar heating but in the way we practice every facet of architecture and in the way we live each moment of our lives. Each of us will talk to hundreds of other persons this year. If what we say to them is, in effect, nothing more than an earth-covered version of what we\'ve always said we\'U get nowhere. To build underground simply to save fuel in order to go on living just as we did before is a perversion of a potentially good idea.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to catch fire with a dream.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to see, and tell others about, a future world almost as beautiful and as timeless as the one we just destroyed. (Two hundred years to erase a continent-wide wilderness was not a very long time.) We\'ve got to practice sky-mining instead of earth-mining. And we\'ve got to get back in tune with the nature song, the one that goes something like this...</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilderness was not just one of, say, a dozen wholly different responses to the physical environment and resources here on earth. The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well. It seems virtually certain that no other response to the earth environment can last very long. Whatever we do, it\'s got to be pretty much like what natural systems are. For proof of this, look around you; everything out of step with those systems is already in trouble.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoveling dirt onto a building is not exactly what I mean by getting back into step with natural systems. They\'re so complex that billions of observers over thousands of years have so far failed to understand them all. Shoveling dirt onto a building is but one tiny step toward a whole earth architecture no one has yet even begun to conceive: A lot more of those tiny steps have got to be taken before we can say we\'ve taken one big one. And the steps must be danced to the nature tune or they will continue to be nothing more than steps taken backward. The natural world is  the way. All we can do is mimic it, use it, grope for its principles, and hope there\'s still time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\'t have the slightest idea what happens to make an egg turn into a man, or a man into compost, or compost into plant substance, or plant substance turn into an egg, but I do know that that\'s the way this particular world happens to work. I have a superficial view of such metamorphoses but as to what really goes on I haven\'t a clue. All I know is that a miracle is at work all around me, and inside of me, every minute of the day. All lean hope to do for it is to stay out of its way, to let it happen with as little interference as possible, and to try to do better each time I fall,.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way I could live in perfect harmony with the natural world would be to throw away my credit cards, my clothes, my toothbrush, my Blue Cross, my vitamins, my house, my car — everything — and walk off into the bush, naked, ready to win or lose on my cunning alone.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With luck, I might last as long as two days, so I\'ve got to find another way to Uve successfully, and that\'s what architecture should be all about: trying to compromise with nature, trying to find alternative ways of life compatible with the right way, the naked-in-the-wilderness way. If we still had a wild instinct we might find them a lot faster, but we traded that instinct for a brain, and so must think our way along, step by step.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have neither the time nor the inclination to study natural systems in any detail. I\'m nowhere near smart enough anyway. I\'ve got to keep it simple.

Admittedly, it\'s highly subjective and very unscientific, but even when I cheat badly in favor of myself the damning message is still there. If the score comes out plus, I\'m going forward; negative, back. It\'s not as easy as it sounds; almost every building that you and I have ever seen earns a negative score on this scale. The exceptions: a few — an extremely few —  really well thought out solar and wind-powered buildings, some wilderness shelters, and perhaps the huts of primitive people far from civilization. Your house, my house. New York City, your favorite building — aU are deep in the red; disasters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about Oklahoma State University for a moment. What was the land like before the buildings and lawns covered it? Was it healthier then? Where does all the rainwater go now? Where does the food come from? Is sunlight used to run the university? Then where does its energy come from? At what cost? Where do all the wastes go? Do these buildings respond to natural cycles, to the seasons? Where is all the wildlife? Would you want to live here all your hfe? Is a bitter windy day — or a blazing hot one — tempered or intensified by the architecture of this campus? Is OSU beautiful? Does it please the eye the way a natural landscape does? Or is it simply a collection of architectural ego trips?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\'s Oklahoma State University on the wilderness values scale: Imagine: a large and well-endowed seat of learning in a state which depends upon healthy land for much of its income, earning a destructively negative score on a scale of life values any eighth grader could understand That score, that minus-850 score, is the central, overriding fact about OSU. It is the grinding truth about all the OSUs in America, and about the civilization that continues to produce them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do we see, most of us, when we visit this campus? We don\'t see disaster. We see the home of a big football team, or we see wide lawns, brick buildings, and another generation of young Americans being educated. How can we dare call ourselves expert at anything until we can see the central truth about what it is we\'re all doing?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where land is healthy and all creatures are in tune with it, plants — living green plants — cover almost every inch. They do everything that architecture — even earth-sheltered architecture — does not do. Plants manage the soil resource, giving us food and fuel and oxygen, collecting rainwater for earth storage, preventing erosion, reusing all wastes, providing wildlife habitat, responding to the seasons, offering us shelter, and creating the stunning panoramas we flee cities to enjoy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architects are professional destroyers of plants. We\'re taught to be. We set aside green areas only grudgingly, after all building requirements have been met, when in any but a sick society architecture would start with plants, if only out of enlightened self-interest, start with concern for their health and the health of the land, and then see if a building or a road or a bit of mowed lawn would cause an unacceptable level of damage.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we ever manage to get ourselves around to that way of thinking we may even begin to have some impact upon The Problem itself. The big one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an important message, to all who pass, from any truly appropriate architectural response to a site, not so much from the actual, physical good being done by the building as from the signals it broadcasts. When a building is appropriate and beautiful  we don\'t even need wilderness scales to tell us it\'s right. It can show us — and say to the hungry world all around — that those wasteful, unthinking Americans have finally begun to change. That\'s when we can start to have real hope for the future again, for once a good idea is set loose in the world its power can be greater than that of a thermonuclear bomb.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows in the hillsides will signal the reemergence of both a healthy land and a healthy people — if  the buildings behind those windows are truly in tune with the nature song.

Ninety-nine percent of humanity has lived on only about five per cent of the earth, and anyone who went outside of it — the tiny minority that went to sea, for example — immediately found himself outside the law. And the whole development of technology has been in the outlaw area, where you\'re dealing with the toughness of nature. I find this fascinating and utterly true. All improvement has to be made in the outlaw area. You can\'t reform man, and you can\'t improve his situation where he is. But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the outlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Present outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers. One thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The finding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area?</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities? (Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it. Any design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. —<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><i>SB</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Loose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island. For society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">For the individual it serves as an always possible</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back. For evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness is the preservation of the world.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out. Depending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers — the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If we run out of that resource, can </span><span class=\"s1\">we synthesize it, or intentionally </span><span class=\"s1\">preserve it?

Billions of years of evolution have given us all a powerful will to live. Intervening in the birth rate goes against our evolutionary values. During all those centuries of our evolutionary past, the individuals who had the most children passed on their genetic endowment in greater quantities than those who reproduced less. Their genes dominate our heredity today. The reproductive function of sex must be shown as just one of its functions, and one that must be carefully regulated in relation to the needs of the individual and society. Much emphasis must be placed on sex as an interpersonal relationship, as an important and extremely pleasurable aspect of being human, as mankind’s major and most enduring recreation, as a fountainhead of his humor, as a phenomenon that affects every aspect of his being.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The battle to feed all of humanity is over.

But these programs will only provide a stay of execution unless they are accompanied by determined and successful efforts at population control. Population control is the conscious regulation of the numbers of human beings to meet the needs, not just of individual families, but of society as a whole.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Nothing could be more misleading to our children than our present affluent society. They will inherit a totally different world, a world in which the standards, politics, and economics of the 1960’s are dead.

We are today involved in the events leading to famine; tomorrow we may be destroyed by its consequences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Remember also that in virtually all underdeveloped countries, people have gotten the word about the better life it is possible to have. They have seen colored pictures in magazines of the miracles of Western technology. They have seen automobiles and airplanes. They have seen American and European movies. Many have seen refrigerators, tractors, and even TV sets. Almost all have heard transistor radios. They know that a better life is possible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">They have what we like to call ‘rising expectations.’ If twice as many people are to be happy, the miracle of doubling what they now have will not be enough. It will only maintain today’s standard of living. There will have to be a tripling or better. Needless to say, they are not going to be happy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A ship has hit the rocks and is sinking. The passengers scream for help.

One of their number suggests that they can help man the pumps. ‘Oh, no!” shout the others. ‘That might hurt the captain’s feelings. Besides, pumping is not our business. It’s outside our field of competence.’ You can guess what they do. They appoint a committee to Study the problem, with subcommittees on marine engineering and navigation. They announce to the passengers that In two or three years the committee will produce a wonderful report which will be acceptable to the passengers, the captain, and the steamship line.

No two organisms that compete in every activity can coexist</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">indefinitely in the same environment. To coexist in time, organisms that are potentially completely competitive must be geographically isolated from each other. Otherwise, the one that is the less efficient yields to the more efficient, no matter how slight the difference. When two competing organisms coexist in the same geographical region, close examination always shows that they are not complete competitors, that one of them draws on a resource of the environment that is not available to the other. The corollary of the principle is that where there is no geographical isolation of genetically and reproductively isolated populations, there must be as many ecological niches as there are populations. The necessary condition for geographical coexistence is ecological specialization. Darwin’s life is symbolic. He who is to see what other men have not seen must, in a real sense, become alienated from the crowd. The manner in which this alienation occurs Is subject to an infinity of permutations...</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The wealthy eccentric is a nearly extinct dodo. The man of wealth is now an other-directed man. He may become a lawyer or a doctor. But not a scientist. He is too much a part of the world to achieve the alienation required to be creative.

The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well. It seems virtually certain that no other response to the earth environment can last very long. Whatever we do, it\'s got to be pretty much like what natural systems are. For proof of this, look around you; everything out of step with those systems is already in trouble.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoveling dirt onto a building is not exactly what I mean by getting back into step with natural systems. They\'re so complex that billions of observers over thousands of years have so far failed to understand them all. Shoveling dirt onto a building is but one tiny step toward a whole earth architecture no one has yet even begun to conceive: A lot more of those tiny steps have got to be taken before we can say we\'ve taken one big one. And the steps must be danced to the nature tune or they will continue to be nothing more than steps taken backward. The natural world is  the way.

Your house, my house. New York City, your favorite building — aU are deep in the red; disasters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about Oklahoma State University for a moment. What was the land like before the buildings and lawns covered it? Was it healthier then? Where does all the rainwater go now? Where does the food come from? Is sunlight used to run the university? Then where does its energy come from? At what cost? Where do all the wastes go? Do these buildings respond to natural cycles, to the seasons? Where is all the wildlife? Would you want to live here all your hfe? Is a bitter windy day — or a blazing hot one — tempered or intensified by the architecture of this campus? Is OSU beautiful? Does it please the eye the way a natural landscape does? Or is it simply a collection of architectural ego trips?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\'s Oklahoma State University on the wilderness values scale: Imagine: a large and well-endowed seat of learning in a state which depends upon healthy land for much of its income, earning a destructively negative score on a scale of life values any eighth grader could understand That score, that minus-850 score, is the central, overriding fact about OSU. It is the grinding truth about all the OSUs in America, and about the civilization that continues to produce them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do we see, most of us, when we visit this campus? We don\'t see disaster. We see the home of a big football team, or we see wide lawns, brick buildings, and another generation of young Americans being educated. How can we dare call ourselves expert at anything until we can see the central truth about what it is we\'re all doing?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where land is healthy and all creatures are in tune with it, plants — living green plants — cover almost every inch. They do everything that architecture — even earth-sheltered architecture — does not do. Plants manage the soil resource, giving us food and fuel and oxygen, collecting rainwater for earth storage, preventing erosion, reusing all wastes, providing wildlife habitat, responding to the seasons, offering us shelter, and creating the stunning panoramas we flee cities to enjoy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architects are professional destroyers of plants. We\'re taught to be. We set aside green areas only grudgingly, after all building requirements have been met, when in any but a sick society architecture would start with plants, if only out of enlightened self-interest, start with concern for their health and the health of the land, and then see if a building or a road or a bit of mowed lawn would cause an unacceptable level of damage.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we ever manage to get ourselves around to that way of thinking we may even begin to have some impact upon The Problem itself. The big one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an important message, to all who pass, from any truly appropriate architectural response to a site, not so much from the actual, physical good being done by the building as from the signals it broadcasts. When a building is appropriate and beautiful  we don\'t even need wilderness scales to tell us it\'s right. It can show us — and say to the hungry world all around — that those wasteful, unthinking Americans have finally begun to change. That\'s when we can start to have real hope for the future again, for once a good idea is set loose in the world its power can be greater than that of a thermonuclear bomb.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windows in the hillsides will signal the reemergence of both a healthy land and a healthy people — if  the buildings behind those windows are truly in tune with the nature song.

Wells was talking to a bunch of them on April 18,1980, at the National Technical Conference, Earth Sheltered Building Design Innovations, Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma City. As follows. (See also Wells\' book.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground Designs, p. 240, and How to Buy Solar Heating without Getting Burnt, p. 189.) -SB</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s pretty satisfying to cover a building with earth and then watch the utility bills shrink.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the roof doesn\'t leak — or collapse — the temptation to congratulate oneself is at times almost irresistible. Just think: natural shelter from all extremes of heat and cold, shelter made of ordinary on-site subsoil, a material not yet thought to be in very short supply. It\'s satisfying to live and work underground, too, satisfying in more ways than that of energy saving.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\'s the silence, the security, the in-tune-ness you feel, not to mention the reduced outdoor maintenance costs, so those of us in the earth-shelter business tend to lose our perspectives just as easily as anyone else. We get smug. We think we have found The Solution. The fact that earth-shelter has almost no measurable effect upon The Problem is swept away by our ovro self-satisfaction. The Problem is something a bit wider than anything earth-sheltered buildings alone can hope to solve. Most descriptions of it go something like this:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nuclear war,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nuclear accidents,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starvation/overpopulation</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the growth of deserts,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> toxic materials in the environment,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> loss of topsoil,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the proliferation of pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> destruction of the ozone layer,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> increasing concentrations of atmospheric COj,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> overpaving,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the depletion of natural resources,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> genetic manipulation,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the extinction of species,</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> habitat destruction, etc., etc., all the way down to an</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exploding crime rate, and</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inflation.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are, in other words, in a colossal mess, the scale of which is so vast there appears, in statistical terms, to be Httle hope of our correcting it before life itself — certainly every higher form of life — disappears.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet there is  hope.

So what, if we build half a million earth-sheltered buildings by the year 2000? How many of the other kind will we have built during the same period? So what, if we built ten million  earth-sheltered buildings?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or a hundred million? If the world situation is 80% hopeless right now, all our underground efforts during the next generation could at best improve it to, say, 79.6% hopeless, unless  we can take some sort of giant leap forward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not meant to be discouraging. My intention is to make us see our work in proper perspective, to show us how terribly important it is that we commit ourselves to doing our best — and then some —  not only in earth shelter and solar heating but in the way we practice every facet of architecture and in the way we live each moment of our lives. Each of us will talk to hundreds of other persons this year. If what we say to them is, in effect, nothing more than an earth-covered version of what we\'ve always said we\'U get nowhere. To build underground simply to save fuel in order to go on living just as we did before is a perversion of a potentially good idea.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to catch fire with a dream.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve got to see, and tell others about, a future world almost as beautiful and as timeless as the one we just destroyed. (Two hundred years to erase a continent-wide wilderness was not a very long time.) We\'ve got to practice sky-mining instead of earth-mining. And we\'ve got to get back in tune with the nature song, the one that goes something like this...</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilderness was not just one of, say, a dozen wholly different responses to the physical environment and resources here on earth. The silent green world from which we so recently evolved was a precisely-balanced organism making the fullest use of the available resources compatible with long-term existence.  It was a stable solar economy, in other words. It was the  answer, no matter how many other variations on its basic theme different mutations might have produced. It was a green, solar, recycling, soil-enriching, clean, efficient, complex community, and we must get back in step with it if we are to have a long-term existence as well. It seems virtually certain that no other response to the earth environment can last very long. Whatever we do, it\'s got to be pretty much like what natural systems are. For proof of this, look around you; everything out of step with those systems is already in trouble.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoveling dirt onto a building is not exactly what I mean by getting back into step with natural systems. They\'re so complex that billions of observers over thousands of years have so far failed to understand them all. Shoveling dirt onto a building is but one tiny step toward a whole earth architecture no one has yet even begun to conceive: A lot more of those tiny steps have got to be taken before we can say we\'ve taken one big one. And the steps must be danced to the nature tune or they will continue to be nothing more than steps taken backward. The natural world is  the way. All we can do is mimic it, use it, grope for its principles, and hope there\'s still time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\'t have the slightest idea what happens to make an egg turn into a man, or a man into compost, or compost into plant substance, or plant substance turn into an egg, but I do know that that\'s the way this particular world happens to work.

But when you\'ve made things so good out there in the outlaw area that they can\'t help being recognized, then gradually they get assimilated.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>[From Calvin Tomkin\'s profile of Fuller, \" In the Outlaw Area\", The New Yorker, Jan. 8, 1966]</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Present outlaw areas include space, the oceans, mountains, desert, northwoods and tundra, jungle, and then places like molecular biology, your mind, and other state-of-theart frontiers whose languages are still foreign to lawmakers. One thing we need is better outlaws. The antidote to external routine is internal routine, not sloppiness. The finding and following of your own drum. Help save the world: do something wrong today. Do it today because time is short, and capable outlaws aren\'t made overnight Is it a contradiction to design an outlaw area?</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In the past there was always undesignable frontier to serve, some space left over or not reached yet. If we run out of that resource, I can we synthesize it, or intentionally preserve it? Or will it spontaneously bubble back up in the middle of our cities? (Oh yes.) I suggest that we must give the devil his due or I he will surely extract it. Any design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens. Here\'s I one. —<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><i>SB</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">[/full_width][two_fifth padding=\"10px 10px 10px 10px\"]</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Loose Talk 1: The Outlaw Area</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The specific fantasy called OUTLAW AREA is a geographical place where anything goes. Let\'s say it\'s an island. For society it functions as a human dumping station. When a guy gets a jail sentence he has the choice of serving the sentence or being deported to the Island. He can\'t come back for some specific period of time, or he must meet some bureaucratic criteria to return, or the expulsion is permanent. Yessir, put all the bad apples in one bad apple barrel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">For the individual it serves as an always possible</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">alternative to the situation he\'s in. rie can simply split for the Island and take his chances there. No one\'s going to try to get him back. For evolution it\'s an open end, a place for other stuff to happen. High energy, minimum prior form, violent range of constant inputs; it should be wild. \"In wildness is the preservation of the world.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It\'s difficult to imagine how it would be in the Outlaw Area. You can project some from the history of Australia, once a penal colony, or from the present underworld. Robert Heinlein has a book about the Moon as a penal colony called “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress”. It\'s kind of nice: they have a revolution and throw the jailers out. Depending on the size of the island, my expectation would be either a dictatorship or warfare of rival gangs, like in old China, warlords. Maybe not though. This is a different age. The Island might become an Aquarian haven for the most useful pioneers — the cream and the dregs of society, (Kesey\'s notion) bending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If we run out of that resource, can </span><span class=\"s1\">we synthesize it, or intentionally </span><span class=\"s1\">preserve it?

We got the power, here comes the responsibility. Whether you prefer to embrace it, or flee it (some should, for safeguard), or stay trembling where you are, you might as well have some detailed idea of what’s looming. This book, by the Science Editor at LIFE, does good journalism on three spooky areas: Refabrication of the Individual; Exploration of Prenativity; Control of the Brain and Behavior. Hypothesis: changes this radical outdistance the laws but not the economy. Control diminishes for governments and increases for consumers. The outlaw area of rapid change. Witness dope. <span class=\"s1\"><i>—</i></span> SB</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Coming: The control of life. All of life, including human life. With man himself at the controls.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Also coming: a new Genesis — The Second Genesis. The creator this time around — man. The creation — again, man. But a new man. In a new image. A whole series of new images. What will the new images be? They have to be quite different from the images we have known — the images that have led us to Vietnam, to turbulent racial conflict, to nuclear confrontation, to the threat of a polluted and overpopulated planet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">But all these things have come about — have they not? — with man at the controls, more or less. If he is acquiring awesome new powers — and he is — with immeasurably greater controls, does this not accelerate us all, at uncountable G\'s, toward the inevitable Dead End — a hundred bangs, followed by three billion whimpers? If we believe so, yes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">But man\'s new images may offer us surprising alternatives. Their creation will require the energetic projection of the best minds of the race to the farthest reaches of their imaginations. Futile effort? Anything but. What we believe about man, what we want for man, will profoundly influence what actually happens to man. What would you like: Education by injection? A catalog of spare body parts? A larger, more efficient brain? A cure for old age? Immortality through freezing? Parentless children? Custom-ordered body size and skin color? The ability to convert sunlight directly into energy, just as plants do, without utilizing food as an intermediary? Name it, and somebody is seriously proposing it. In sober scientific circles today, there is hardly a subject more commonly discussed than man’s control of his own heredity and evolution. And the discussions seldom leave much doubt that man will acquire this control. It is a matter of when, not if.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Could anyone ever replace a dead-but-frozen ruler? As billions of people were frozen in every generation, the dead might ultimately own all! Barring the return of some sort of ancestor worship or a cult of the dead, would the unfrozen population put up with it? With life so overabundant and so easy to produce a new, why should anyone want to go to all the trouble and expense of reviving all that competition? If the planet became desperately overpopulated, with prevailing undernourishment and contempt for life, their very presence might even encourage a drift toward cannibalism. “There is no doubt,” says Richard R. Landers “that machines as a group will dominate man as a group, and eventually, individual machines will dominate individual men.”</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The Second Genesis', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '87-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-02 18:37:27', '2018-08-02 18:37:27', '', 87, 'http://localhost/wpp3/87-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Despite his many personality flaws, he is also depicted as being highly intelligent, outspoken, cunning and streetwise.
